**Title**: CO₂-Absorbing Urban Textiles with Regeneration and Circular Economy Integration

**Key Idea**: Urban textiles embedded with regenerable CO₂-capturing materials can be periodically refreshed for continuous carbon sequestration, linking with urban circular economy systems.

**Paragraph**: To address saturation and waste, textiles with reversible CO₂-binding materials (e.g., switchable amine polymers or metal-organic frameworks) can be regenerated using mild heat or chemical washes, enabling repeated use. Spent CO₂ can be routed to local utilization (e.g., algae bioreactors), and textiles can be recycled, supporting circular economy principles [Lackner 2012; Goto 2014; Sumida 2012].

**Approach**: Develop textiles with regenerable CO₂ sorbents, establish collection/regeneration logistics, and pilot in city installations. Track CO₂ capture, regeneration cycles, and material lifespan.

**Modifications**:  
- Added regenerable materials, periodic refreshing, and circular economy considerations  
- New citation on MOFs and regeneration  
**Strengthening**: Ensures sustained sequestration, reduces waste, and supports urban sustainability.
