**Title**: Urban Carbon Capture Gamification Platforms for Community Engagement and Data Crowdsourcing

**Key Idea**: Interactive digital platforms that gamify urban carbon capture activities can incentivize community participation and generate valuable data for optimizing city-scale sequestration strategies.

**Paragraph**: Public engagement is critical for the adoption and maintenance of urban carbon capture solutions. Gamified apps can track individual or community contributions (e.g., maintaining green walls, reporting biochar yields, managing textile installations), reward sustainable behavior, and crowdsource data on system performance and maintenance needs. This

**Approach**: leverages behavioral science to enhance uptake and provides real-time feedback to city managers [Howe 2017; Johnson 2016].

**Approach**: Develop user-friendly apps with point systems, leaderboards, and rewards for verified carbon capture actions. Integrate with sensors/IoT devices for automated data logging, and test in selected urban districts for engagement and impact assessment.

**Summary of Refinements**  
- Enhanced technical depth (multi-trait engineering, sensor integration, smart controls)  
- Added dual/multi-benefits and circularity  
- Incorporated retrofitting and digital monitoring  
- Emphasized public engagement and lifecycle approaches  
- New ideas expand to algae bioreactors and behavioral platforms, filling gaps in biological integration and human dimensions

All ideas now have strengthened hypotheses, clearer implementation pathways, and robust citation support.
