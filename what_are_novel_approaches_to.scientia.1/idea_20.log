**Title**: Urban Carbon Capture Integration with District Heating and Cooling Networks

**Key Idea**: Embedding direct air capture or CO₂-utilizing processes within urban district heating/cooling networks can synergistically utilize waste heat for carbon removal at scale.

**Paragraph**: Urban district energy networks often generate excess low-grade heat and operate at city scale. Integrating DAC modules or CO₂ mineralization processes within these systems allows the utilization of waste heat for CO₂ capture, while also potentially providing chilled water or heating as a byproduct. This co-location reduces costs and leverages existing infrastructure, enabling scalable, distributed urban carbon removal [Reiner 2016; Realmonte 2019; Bui 2018].

**Approach**: - Identify integration points in existing district heating/cooling networks.  
- Deploy pilot DAC/mineralization modules using network waste heat.  
- Monitor energy/carbon flows and system co-benefits.  
- Model economic and climate impacts at city scale.

**Differentiation**:  
- Focuses on integration with city-scale energy infrastructure and co-utilization of waste heat, a unique angle.
