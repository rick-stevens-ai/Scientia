**Title**: Engineered Microbial Networks with Automated Monitoring for Urban Sewer Carbon Capture

**Key Idea**: Deploying engineered, adaptive microbial consortia with automated monitoring in wastewater systems can convert atmospheric and dissolved CO₂ into valuable products with high efficiency and stability.

**Paragraph**: Beyond simple CO₂ fixation, designer microbial consortia can be tuned to convert CO₂ into a range of valuable outputs (bioplastics, biogas, biofertilizers) while maintaining robustness to fluctuating wastewater conditions. Integrating real-time biochemical sensors and machine learning for adaptive process control optimizes carbon capture and system resilience [Kumar 2021; Claassens 2016; Wu 2021].

**Approach**: Engineer modular microbial consortia for multiple CO₂-based conversions, integrate sensor arrays and AI-driven control for adaptive optimization, and pilot in urban wastewater/sewer segments. Quantify carbon balance, product yields, and operational stability.

**Modifications**:  
- Added value-added product generation  
- Introduced adaptive, automated monitoring/control  
- New citation for smart bioreactor integration  
**Strengthening**: Increases efficiency, economic value, and operational reliability.
