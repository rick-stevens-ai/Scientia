**Title**: Urban Algae Facades for Integrated Carbon Capture, Cooling, and Biomass Production

**Key Idea**: Transparent photobioreactor panels with high-efficiency microalgae can be incorporated into building facades to capture CO₂, reduce heat load, and generate valuable biomass.

**Paragraph**: Algae have rapid CO₂ uptake and can thrive in modular photobioreactor systems. Installing algae panels as architectural facades on buildings exploits vertical space, shades interiors for energy savings, and provides continuous biomass harvest for biofuel, food, or fertilizer. This

**Approach**: offers a visually striking, multipurpose urban climate solution [Schetters 2017; Lee 2016; Brennan 2010].

**Approach**: Design and install algae photobioreactor facades on pilot buildings, monitor CO₂ capture, energy savings, biomass output, and user acceptance. Assess integration with urban microclimates and downstream biomass uses.
