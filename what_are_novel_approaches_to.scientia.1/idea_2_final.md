## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Urban Carbon Capture Integration with District Energy Networks and Circular Resource Valorization

**Key Idea**: Embedding modular direct air capture and CO₂ utilization processes within urban district heating/cooling networks—coupled with resource circularity—can optimize waste heat use, enable carbon removal at scale, and create value-added urban products.

**Paragraph**: Urban district energy systems generate abundant low-grade waste heat and operate city-wide, providing a unique substrate for distributed direct air capture (DAC) or CO₂ mineralization. By integrating modular DAC or mineralization units at strategic network points, these systems can harvest waste heat for CO₂ capture, channel captured carbon into local construction materials (e.g., carbon-cured concrete), and provide ancillary heating/cooling services. This

**Approach**: not only reduces operational costs and emissions, but also closes local material loops and supports urban infrastructure resilience [Reiner 2016; Realmonte 2019; Bui 2018; Lackner 2022; Lehne 2020].

**Approach**:  
- Map and analyze district energy network flows to identify optimal sites for DAC/mineralization integration.  
- Deploy modular DAC units and/or mineralization reactors using waste heat and, where possible, captured CO₂ for local material production (e.g., aggregates, building panels).  
- Monitor system-wide energy, carbon, and material flows, assessing impacts on network efficiency and urban circularity.  
- Conduct techno-economic and environmental assessments, including life cycle analysis of urban CO₂-derived products.  
- Scale pilots across varied urban typologies to model city-wide impact.

**Refinement Summary**:  
- **Extended** by explicitly linking captured CO₂ to local material production, closing urban carbon loops.
- **Extended** to circular resource valorization, not just energy/carbon flows.
- **Strengthened** by adding life cycle and techno-economic analysis.
- **New Citations**: Lackner 2022 supports DAC urgency; Lehne 2020 supports CO₂ use in construction materials.
