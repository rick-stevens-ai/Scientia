**Title**: Rooftop Biochar Reactors with Heat Recovery and Urban Food System Integration

**Key Idea**: Distributed biochar reactors on urban rooftops can capture carbon, recover waste heat, and provide soil amendments for hyperlocal food production.

**Paragraph**: Beyond carbon storage, rooftop biochar systems can be integrated with greenhouse or rooftop farm operations, using recovered heat from pyrolysis for season extension and reduced energy use. The resulting biochar enhances soil fertility, closes local waste loops, and supports urban agriculture, multiplying ecological and social benefits [Lehmann 2015; Woolf 2010; Shackley 2012].

**Approach**: Install rooftop biochar units with heat capture for adjacent greenhouses, monitor carbon yields, energy savings, nutrient cycling, and food production impacts in urban pilot sites.

**Modifications**:  
- Added heat recovery and urban agriculture integration  
- New citation on deployment feasibility and system integration  
**Strengthening**: Increases urban sustainability and co-benefits.
