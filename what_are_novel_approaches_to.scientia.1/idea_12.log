**Title**: Networked Urban Air Filtration Hubs with Waste Heat Integration and Smart Grid Connectivity

**Key Idea**: Distributed CO₂ air filtration hubs using regenerable solid sorbents and powered by urban waste heat, coordinated via smart grid connectivity, can cost-effectively capture and concentrate urban CO₂.

**Paragraph**: To address energy costs and scalability, modular DAC units can be sited near sources of low-grade waste heat (e.g., data centers, subway vents) and dynamically managed via smart city infrastructure. This enables efficient regeneration of sorbents, adaptive load balancing, and integration with renewable energy or CO₂ utilization networks, enhancing cost-effectiveness and urban resilience [Sabatino 2021; Wurzbacher 2020; Sanz-Pérez 2016].

**Approach**: Deploy modular DAC units at urban waste heat sites, integrate with city energy and data networks for smart scheduling and load management, and evaluate CO₂ capture efficiency, operational costs, and system scalability.

**Modifications**:  
- Added waste heat utilization and smart grid integration  
- New citation on DAC technology and system integration  
**Strengthening**: Reduces energy costs, improves scalability, and leverages urban infrastructure.
