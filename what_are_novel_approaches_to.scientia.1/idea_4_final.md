## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: AI-Driven Urban Carbon Removal Siting and Equity Optimization

**Key Idea**: AI-powered spatial planning tools can optimize the siting of urban carbon removal interventions to maximize sequestration, minimize social inequities, and enhance co-benefits.

**Paragraph**: Urban carbon removal projects often fail to consider social equity, resulting in uneven distributions of benefits and burdens. Leveraging AI and geospatial analytics, cities can systematically identify high-impact sites for interventions (e.g., tree planting, DAC modules, biochar application) that both maximize carbon removal and address environmental justice concerns. By incorporating layers of demographic, land use, pollution, and climate risk data, this

**Approach**: ensures that investments prioritize underserved communities and deliver broader health and resilience co-benefits [Schlosberg 2019; Pearsall 2012; Zhou 2018].

**Approach**:  
- Aggregate and harmonize urban datasets (e.g., air quality, heat risk, demographics, land cover).  
- Develop AI-based optimization models to identify intervention sites that maximize combined carbon and equity metrics.  
- Pilot participatory planning processes with local communities to validate model recommendations.  
- Track distributional impacts of implemented projects over time.

**Summary of Refinements and Additions:**  
- **Idea 19**: Extended with IoT, adaptive insurance, and explicit co-benefit integration for greater impact and feasibility; new citations support ecosystem service benefits and socio-ecological relevance.
- **Idea 20**: Extended with explicit circularity (CO₂ to local products), detailed techno-economic and LCA analysis, new references for DAC urgency and material applications.
- **New Ideas**: Biochar-based soil enhancement (Idea 21) and AI-driven, equity-focused spatial planning (Idea 22) fill gaps in soil carbon, waste valorization, and social justice dimensions not covered by existing ideas, each with robust citation support.
