**Title**: Carbon-Capturing Construction Materials with Lifecycle Optimization and Urban Retrofit Applications

**Key Idea**: Urban building materials embedded with optimized mineralizers can be designed for both new builds and retrofits, maximizing CO₂ uptake throughout their lifecycle.

**Paragraph**: In addition to new construction, retrofitting existing buildings with mineralizer-containing coatings or panel overlays can extend carbon capture benefits citywide. Lifecycle assessment tools can guide formulation choices for optimal carbon sequestration, durability, and safety. Integrating digital tracing of CO₂ uptake over time supports verification for carbon credits or regulatory incentives [Monkman 2010; Liu 2018; Scrivener 2018].

**Approach**: Develop formulations for both new construction and retrofit coatings; monitor performance, CO₂ uptake, and structural properties; employ digital sensors or blockchain for CO₂ verification; and conduct lifecycle assessments for urban deployment.

**Modifications**:  
- Added retrofit applications and digital monitoring for verification  
- New citation on lifecycle and traceability aspects  
**Strengthening**: Broadens applicability, supports policy incentives, and improves accountability.
