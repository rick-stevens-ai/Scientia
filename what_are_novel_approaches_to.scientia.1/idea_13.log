**Title**: Managed Alkalinity Enhancement in Urban Waterways with Automated Ecological Safeguards

**Key Idea**: Smart-controlled dosing of alkaline materials in urban waterways, guided by real-time ecological and chemical monitoring, can safely optimize in-situ CO₂ mineralization.

**Paragraph**: While alkalinity addition can enhance CO₂ mineralization, there are risks to water chemistry and ecosystems. By deploying automated dosing systems linked to sensors tracking pH, carbonate saturation, and biotic indicators, interventions can be dynamically modulated to maximize CO₂ capture while preventing ecological harm. Coupling with local waste-derived alkaline sources (e.g., concrete wash water) increases sustainability [Renforth 2019; Rau 2017; Wu 2020].

**Approach**: Develop sensor-controlled alkalinity dosing infrastructure, conduct pilot studies in urban waterways, evaluate carbonate precipitation, ecological impacts, and carbon sequestration efficiency using both industrial and natural alkaline wastes.

**Modifications**:  
- Added real-time, automated ecological monitoring  
- Included circular use of local alkaline waste streams  
- New citation on ecological monitoring  
**Strengthening**: Boosts safety, sustainability, and public acceptance.
