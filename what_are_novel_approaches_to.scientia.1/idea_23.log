**Title**: Urban Soil Carbon Enhancement via Biochar Integration in Green Infrastructure

**Key Idea**: Incorporating biochar into urban soils and green infrastructure can enhance carbon sequestration, soil health, and climate resilience in cities.

**Paragraph**: Urban soils are often degraded and have limited carbon storage potential. Integrating biochar—produced from local organic waste—into green spaces, street tree pits, and stormwater infrastructure can lock away stable carbon for centuries while improving soil fertility, water retention, and pollutant buffering capacity. This

**Approach**: leverages waste-to-resource pathways, reduces landfill emissions, and provides co-benefits for urban vegetation and flood resilience, offering a scalable, multi-benefit carbon removal solution for cities [Lehmann 2015; Sohi 2012; Shackley 2012].

**Approach**:  
- Develop urban biochar production facilities using local biomass waste streams (e.g., wood trimmings, food waste).  
- Apply biochar to urban soils across parks, street trees, and green stormwater systems.  
- Quantify changes in soil carbon, fertility, and water retention through field trials and remote sensing.  
- Integrate biochar application into municipal green infrastructure and waste management strategies.
