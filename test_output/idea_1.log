**Title**: Quantum Transfer Learning

**Key Idea**: Quantum circuits can accelerate transfer learning by encoding pre-trained classical neural network weights into quantum states.

**Paragraph**: Transfer learning has become a powerful technique in deep learning, allowing models trained on one task to be adapted to new tasks. This approach proposes a hybrid quantum-classical framework where pre-trained classical neural network weights are encoded into quantum states, enabling faster adaptation to new domains. By leveraging quantum parallelism during the fine-tuning phase, this method could significantly reduce the computational resources needed for transfer learning on large models.

**Approach**: Implement a quantum circuit that can encode classical neural network weights as quantum states, then perform parallel quantum operations to explore multiple fine-tuning configurations simultaneously. Benchmark against classical transfer learning approaches on image classification and natural language processing tasks to measure speedup and accuracy. Explore different quantum encoding strategies to maximize the advantage over classical approaches.
