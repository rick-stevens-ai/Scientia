**Title**: Quantum Attention Mechanism

**Key Idea**: A quantum attention mechanism can efficiently model complex dependencies in sequence data by using quantum superposition for parallel attention computation.

**Paragraph**: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized natural language processing and other sequence modeling tasks, but they are computationally intensive. This approach proposes a quantum attention mechanism that exploits quantum superposition to compute attention weights for all sequence positions in parallel. By mapping sequence tokens to quantum states and performing quantum operations that calculate attention scores in superposition, we can achieve quadratic speedup in attention computation compared to classical approaches.

**Approach**: Design quantum circuits that encode sequence tokens as quantum states and implement quantum operations to compute attention weights in superposition. Develop a hybrid architecture where classical neural networks pre-process inputs and post-process quantum attention outputs. Evaluate the method on standard NLP benchmarks and compare with classical attention mechanisms in terms of speed and quality.
