## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Two-Photon NIR/β-Lactamase Dual-Gated NO Donors for Precision Therapy of Deep MRSA Abscesses

**Key Idea**: Cephalosporin-diazeniumdiolate conjugates capped with a two-photon cleavable nitrobenzyl cage release NO only after enzymatic hydrolysis and 900 nm illumination, sparing healthy tissue.

**Paragraph**: Two-photon excitation penetrates centimetres of tissue, enabling treatment of deep abscesses without incision.  Coupling this with β-lactamase gating maintains pathogen specificity.

**Approach**: Synthesis of two-photon cages; NO EPR imaging; murine thigh abscess fibrescope illumination; gut-on-chip commensal-sparing assays.

**Key References**: Fang 2011; Sailaja 2013; Li 2022; NEW—König & Ruck-Bauer, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2021 (two-photon cages) [König 2021].  
Modifications: Substituted single-photon with two-photon cage and added EPR imaging + gut-on-chip safety tests.
