# Final Report: Idea 43

## Final ELO Score: 1234.2

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Small-Molecule LLPS Modulators Dispersing Wag31 Condensates to Block Polar Growth

**Key Idea**: Amphiphilic “condensolytic” compounds disrupt electrostatic interactions underlying Wag31 phase separation, halting mycobacterial elongation.

**Paragraph**: Targeting biomolecular condensates bypasses classical enzyme inhibition and may have low cross-resistance [Banani 2017].

**Approach**: FRAP-based screen of amphipathic molecules; cryo-ET validation; hamster TB efficacy.

**Key References**: Monterroso 2019; Banani 2017; Wang et al., Science, 2021 (small-molecule LLPS disruption) [Wang 2021].  
    Modifications: Added condensolytic chemistry concept; new citation.
