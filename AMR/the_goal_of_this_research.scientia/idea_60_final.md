N-1. Title: Targeted Inhibition of Bacterial RNA Repair Ligase RtcB to Sensitise Pathogens to Host RNases  
     Key Idea: Small-molecule inhibitors of bacterial RtcB RNA ligase will block repair of host-mediated rRNA and tRNA cleavage, amplifying innate immunity.  
     Paragraph: During oxidative and nitrosative stress, RNases such as RNase L damage bacterial RNA; pathogens rely on RtcB to reseal 3’-phosphate/5’-OH breaks [Das 2020].  Humans use a structurally unrelated ligase, providing selectivity.  
     Approach: Structure-guided virtual screen against E. coli RtcB active site; in vitro ligation assays; macrophage infection with NO donors; murine sepsis survival.  
     Key References: Das et al., Nat. Commun., 2020 [Das 2020]; Popow et al., RNA Biol., 2014 (eukaryotic RNA repair) [Popow 2014].

N-2. Title: Proton Motive Force–Independent Uptake Peptidomimetics to Deliver Gram-Positive-Only Antibiotics into Gram-Negatives

     Paragraph: Many potent Gram-positive agents fail in Gram-negatives due to OM exclusion and PMF-dependent uptake [Wilson 2021].  Arginine-rich motifs traverse membranes via passive uptake, bypassing PMF collapse in resistant strains.  
     Approach: Synthesis of vancomycin-arginine dendrimers; OM permeation assays; Galleria infection; resistance evolution studies.

N-3. Title: CRISPR-i Guided Anti-Plasmid Systems to Eradicate β-Lactamase Resistance Plasmids In Situ  
     Key Idea: Conjugative delivery of dCas9-sgRNA constructs targeting plasmid replication origins will selectively purge resistance plasmids from mixed bacterial communities.  
     Paragraph: Plasmid curing restores β-lactam susceptibility and limits microbiome disruption; dCas9 avoids cleavage-induced SOS mutagenesis [Hamilton 2019].

     Paragraph: Recent MurJ cryo-EM structures expose druggable pockets absent from mammalian homologs [Kuk et al., Science, 2019].  
     Approach: MD-guided virtual screening; Lipid II flip assay; murine sepsis model; resistance mapping.  
     Key References: Kuk et al., Science, 2019 [Kuk 2019]; Sham et al., Nat. Chem. Biol., 2014 (MurJ function) [Sham 2014].

N-6. Title: Host-Directed Inhibition of Bacterial Nrf2 Suppressors to Boost Macrophage Oxidative Burst  
     Key Idea: Small molecules that block bacterial effector-mediated Nrf2 degradation preserve host antioxidant signalling, indirectly enhancing bactericidal ROS.
