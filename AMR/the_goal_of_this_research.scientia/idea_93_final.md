# Final Report: Idea 93

## Final ELO Score: 1213.5

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Dual-Stage Enzyme-Triggered PqsR Inhibitors with Lactonase-Resistant Linkers to Disperse H. influenzae Biofilms

**Key Idea**: β-Glucuronidase-cleavable pro-drug releases a stable PqsR inhibitor which is further activated by intracellular esterases, ensuring biofilm-selective activity and high potency.

**Paragraph**: Sequential triggers reduce off-target activation and maintain inhibitor integrity against extracellular lactonases.

**Approach**: Two-step release kinetics; biofilm dispersal; lung infection imaging; microbiome impact.

Modifications: Added two-stage activation to maximise selectivity and potency.
