## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Cleavable Haemin–Rifabutin Conjugates with Self-Immolative Linkers for H. influenzae

**Key Idea**: Disulfide self-immolative linkers ensure drug release in the reductive bacterial cytosol after siderophore-mediated import.

**Paragraph**: Cytosolic release solves earlier conjugate efficacy limits [Morton 2012].

**Approach**: Synthesis, ICP-MS uptake, reductive cleavage kinetics, chinchilla otitis therapy.

**Key References**: Morton 2012; Miethke 2007; Fosgerau & Hoffmann, Drug Discov. Today, 2015 (self-immolative) [Fosgerau 2015].  
    Modifications: Added linker technology; new citation.
