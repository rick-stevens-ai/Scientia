# Final Report: Idea 35

## Final ELO Score: 1217.2

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Bifunctional Cyclic Lipopeptides that Staple LptA to LptD in MDR E. coli

**Key Idea**: A single macrocyclic lipopeptide engaging both LptA and LptD stalls LPS transit, compromising OM integrity even in colistin-resistant strains.

**Paragraph**: Employing a “bridging” pharmacophore lowers required affinity at each site and reduces resistance via dual target occupancy [Silver 2011].  The lipid tail drives self-assembly into OM, boosting local concentration.

**Approach**: MD-guided macrocycle design; TIRF microscopy of LPS kinetics; synergy assays with membrane-impermeant rifampicin; Galleria and murine sepsis models.

**Key References**: Okuda 2016; Bishop 2020; Silver, ACS Infect. Dis., 2011 [Silver 2011].  
   Modifications: Highlighted dual-occupancy rationale and self-assembly; new citation.
