## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Beclin-1 Mimetics Encapsulated in Mannose-Targeted Liposomes to Boost Macrophage Autophagy against TB

**Key Idea**: Mannose-decorated liposomes deliver Beclin-1 mimetics selectively to infective macrophages, synergising with first-line TB drugs.

**Paragraph**: Mannose receptors are upregulated on TB-infected macrophages [Shoji 2013].

**Approach**: Liposome formulation; LC3 flux; granuloma organoid; C3HeB/FeJ therapy.

**Key References**: Gutierrez 2004; Shoji 2013; Cambier et al., Nat. Immunol., 2014 (mannose receptor in TB) [Cambier 2014].  
    Modifications: Added targeted delivery; new citation.
