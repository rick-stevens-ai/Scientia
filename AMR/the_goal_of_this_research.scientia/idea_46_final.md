# Final Report: Idea 46

## Final ELO Score: 1220.6

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Fragment-Derived Molecules that Uncouple VapBC TA Pairs and Induce Self-Destruction in M. tuberculosis

**Key Idea**: High-affinity fragments targeting the hydrophobic VapB pocket release VapC RNases selectively under intracellular acidic pH.

**Paragraph**: Acidic pH-biased binding limits off-target effects on extracellular commensals.

**Approach**: pH-shifted NMR screening; RNA-seq cleavage maps; guinea-pig aerosol therapy.

**Key References**: Ramage 2009; Yamaguchi 2011; Lopez-Moreno et al., Chem. Sci., 2021 (pH-selective binders) [Lopez-Moreno 2021].  
    Modifications: Added pH selectivity; new citation.
