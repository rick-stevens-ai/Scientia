# Final Report: Idea 29

## Final ELO Score: 1217.1

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Targeted Depletion of Bacterial Adenylate Kinase Pools by Covalent SuFEx Chemistry

**Key Idea**: Sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange probes that covalently modify conserved lysines in adenylate kinase can rapidly deplete ATP buffering in Gram-negatives.

**Paragraph**: Adenylate kinase maintains energy homeostasis; covalent inactivation collapses ATP/ADP ratio and sensitises bacteria to stress [Mizote 2020]. SuFEx offers bio-orthogonal selectivity.

**Approach**: Design SuFEx warheads guided by structural lysine mapping, mass-spec confirmation, metabolic flux analysis, rat peritonitis model.

**Key References**: Mizote et al., Chem. Sci., 2020 [Mizote 2020]; Sharpless et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2014 (SuFEx platform) [Sharpless 2014].
