# Final Report: Idea 5

## Final ELO Score: 1222.4

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Dual-Target Lipopeptides Blocking LPS Transport in Multidrug-Resistant E. coli

**Key Idea**: A designed cyclic lipopeptide that simultaneously binds LptA and LptD will arrest lipopolysaccharide trafficking to the outer membrane.

**Paragraph**: The Lpt (lipopolysaccharide transport) pathway is essential and periplasm-exposed, yet largely unexplored as a drug target [Okuda 2016]. A bifunctional molecule tethering LptA- and LptD-binding motifs could trap the transport complex, compromising membrane integrity even in colistin-resistant isolates.

**Approach**: In silico docking guided by solved Lpt structures; synthesise lipo-cyclopeptides, evaluate outer-membrane permeability assays and in vivo activity in Galleria mellonella sepsis model.
