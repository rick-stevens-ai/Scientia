# Final Report: Idea 55

## Final ELO Score: 1166.5

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: ChuS Heme Oxygenase Inhibitors Delivered as Bladder-Instilled Nanomicelles

**Key Idea**: Thiadiazole inhibitors encapsulated in cationic nanomicelles concentrate on urothelium, causing iron overload in UPEC during UTI.

**Paragraph**: Local delivery mitigates systemic exposure and dysbiosis.

**Approach**: Nanomicelle fabrication; ex vivo bladder adherence; UTI mouse model; urine metabolomics.

**Key References**: Anzaldi 2010; Lojewska 2021; Zhang et al., ACS Nano, 2019 (cationic micelles) [Zhang 2019].  
    Modifications: Added nanomicelle delivery; new citation.
