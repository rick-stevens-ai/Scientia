# Final Report: Idea 6

## Final ELO Score: 1188.8

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Chemical Disruption of Mycobacterial Membrane Microdomains

**Key Idea**: Targeting flotillin-like proteins that organise M. tuberculosis lipid rafts will mislocalise cell wall enzymes and inhibit growth.

**Paragraph**: Mycobacteria possess detergent-resistant membrane microdomains enriched in virulence lipids; deletion of the scaffold protein Rv1488 impairs peptidoglycan synthesis [Hayashi 2016]. Small molecules that destabilise these domains could act synergistically with β-lactams.

**Approach**: Phenotypic screening for compounds that delocalise Wag31-GFP in live-cell imaging; mechanistic follow-up with lipidomics; test efficacy in C3HeB/FeJ mouse model.

**Key References**: Hayashi et al., Nat. Chem. Biol., 2016 [Hayashi 2016]; López & Kolter, Curr. Opin. Microbiol., 2010 (bacterial lipid rafts) [López 2010].
