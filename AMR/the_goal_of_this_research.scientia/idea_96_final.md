## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Protease-Stabilised SepM Inhibitors Combined with Pulsed Sub-MIC β-Lactams to Suppress Competence in S. pneumoniae

**Key Idea**: Non-peptidic boronic acid SepM inhibitors resist pneumococcal proteases, and a pulsed β-lactam regimen avoids prolonged stress, jointly preventing horizontal gene transfer during therapy.

**Paragraph**: Stable inhibitors maintain SepM blockade throughout treatment; intermittent β-lactam exposure reduces selection for tolerance while still synergising.

**Approach**: Structure-guided boronate design; transformation assays; ferret co-colonisation; resistome tracking.

**Key References**: Johnston 2013; Kessler 2018; Domenech 2020; NEW—Keam et al., J. Med. Chem., 2021 (boronic protease inhibitors) [Keam 2021].  
Modifications: Introduced non-peptidic scaffold and pulsed antibiotic strategy for durability and lower selection pressure.
