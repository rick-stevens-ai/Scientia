# Final Report: Idea 58

## Final ELO Score: 1177.5

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: ESAT-6–Mimetic α-Helical Peptides Stabilised by Photo-Cross-Linkers to Occlude ESX-1 Pores

**Key Idea**: Photo-cross-linked peptides resist proteolysis and lock ESX-1 pores, blocking phagosomal rupture by M. tuberculosis.

**Paragraph**: Diazirine cross-links inserted at i,i+4 positions retain helicity and allow covalent pore engagement upon UV-A exposure.

**Approach**: Peptide synthesis; liposome leakage; zebrafish embryo infection; UV-A topical application in cutaneous TB.

**Key References**: Houben 2012; Bunduc 2021; Martin et al., Chem. Sci., 2019 (photo-cross-linked helices) [Martin 2019].  
    Modifications: Added photo-cross-linking; new citation.
