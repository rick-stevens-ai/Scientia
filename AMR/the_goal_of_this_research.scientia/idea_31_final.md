## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Dual-Site Inhibition of the Mycobacterial Pup-Proteasome System

**Key Idea**: Simultaneous blockade of PafA ligase active-site and Pup-binding groove will collapse proteasomal protein quality control and sensitise M. tuberculosis to host-derived nitrosative stress.

**Paragraph**: The Pup–proteasome is indispensable for clearance of damaged proteins under macrophage-generated NO/ROS [Darwin 2003].  Recent boronate transition-state analogues show cell penetration but limited breadth [Wei 2020].  A bivalent molecule that bridges PafA’s catalytic cysteine and the Pup-recognition cleft should raise the resistance barrier and potentiate isoniazid activity inside granulomas.

**Approach**: (i) Fragment-linking of covalent boronates (active-site) with non-covalent groove ligands identified by cryo-EM; (ii) time-resolved degradome profiling to confirm pathway shutdown; (iii) nitric-oxide-augmented macrophage assays; (iv) C3HeB/FeJ mouse efficacy and relapse study.

   Modifications: Added dual-site strategy, boronate chemistry, NO synergy, new citation [Wei 2020].

Dual-Site Inhibition of the Mycobacterial Pup-Proteasome System

### Key Idea

Simultaneous blockade of PafA ligase active-site and Pup-binding groove will collapse proteasomal protein quality control and sensitise M. tuberculosis to host-derived nitrosative stress.

### Detailed Explanation

The Pup–proteasome is indispensable for clearance of damaged proteins under macrophage-generated NO/ROS [Darwin 2003].  Recent boronate transition-state analogues show cell penetration but limited breadth [Wei 2020].  A bivalent molecule that bridges PafA’s catalytic cysteine and the Pup-recognition cleft should raise the resistance barrier and potentiate isoniazid activity inside granulomas.

### Implementation Approach

(i) Fragment-linking of covalent boronates (active-site) with non-covalent groove ligands identified by cryo-EM; (ii) time-resolved degradome profiling to confirm pathway shutdown; (iii) nitric-oxide-augmented macrophage assays; (iv) C3HeB/FeJ mouse efficacy and relapse study.
