# Final Report: Idea 39

## Final ELO Score: 1222.6

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Oxidation-Activated Inhibitors of Mtb DnaE2 to Halt Stress-Induced Mutagenesis

**Key Idea**: Redox-sensing pro-inhibitors release DnaE2 blockers only under macrophage oxidative burst, preventing rifampicin resistance with minimal off-target effect.

**Paragraph**: Masking active moieties with ROS-cleavable thioketal caps targets drug to infection sites [Cirz 2007].

**Approach**: Library of thioketal-caged inhibitors; macrophage infection mutation frequency; hollow-fibre dynamic rifampicin co-therapy.

**Key References**: Boshoff 2003; Cirz 2007; Amara et al., Nat. Chem. Biol., 2019 (ROS-responsive drugs) [Amara 2019].  
   Modifications: Introduced redox targeting and co-therapy design; new citation.
