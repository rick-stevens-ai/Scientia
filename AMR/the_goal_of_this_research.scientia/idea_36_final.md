# Final Report: Idea 36

## Final ELO Score: 1216.0

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Flotillin-Raft Destabilisers Potentiating β-Lactams against M. tuberculosis

**Key Idea**: Benzimidazole small molecules that displace Rv1488 from detergent-resistant domains mislocalise peptidoglycan synthases, restoring β-lactam susceptibility.

**Paragraph**: β-lactam efficacy is limited by enzyme spatial organisation; disrupting rafts weakens synergy among PBPs and L,D-transpeptidases [Hayashi 2016; López 2010].

**Approach**: FRET imaging of Wag31-PBP3 colocalisation, lipid raft mass-spec, checkerboard with meropenem-clavulanate, C3HeB/FeJ relapse study.

**Key References**: Hayashi 2016; López 2010; García-Fernández et al., mBio, 2017 (raft inhibitors) [García-Fernández 2017].  
   Modifications: Added synergy mechanism, imaging readouts, new citation.
