## Final ELO Score: 1208.5

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Quorum-Quenching Stapled Peptides Targeting the AgrC Sensor of MRSA

**Key Idea**: α-Helical stapled peptides that lock AgrC in an inactive conformation will silence virulence gene expression in Staphylococcus aureus.

**Paragraph**: The agr quorum-sensing circuit is the master switch for exotoxin production; genetic agr defects render MRSA dramatically less pathogenic [Novick 2003]. Conformationally stabilised peptides mimicking the trans-membrane dimer interface of AgrC could act as dominant-negative inhibitors, representing a non-bactericidal, antivirulence strategy to reduce resistance pressure.

**Approach**: Design stapled peptides via hydrocarbon-stapling, measure binding to purified AgrC with biolayer interferometry, quantify toxin repression (RNAIII levels) in vitro, and evaluate protection in a murine skin abscess model.
