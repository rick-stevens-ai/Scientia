# Final Report: Idea 37

## Final ELO Score: 1218.0

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: β-Lactamase-Activated Photocaged NO Donors with Near-IR Phototrigger

**Key Idea**: Dual-locked pro-drugs require pathogen β-lactamase hydrolysis plus external NIR light to release bactericidal NO, enabling spatial and pathogen selectivity.

**Paragraph**: Combining enzymatic and photonic gating minimises off-target NO delivery and protects microbiota [Fang 2011].

**Approach**: Synthesis of diazeniumdiolate–cephalosporin–BODIPY conjugates; NIR (730 nm) uncaging kinetics; deep-tissue mouse abscess with fibre optic illumination.

**Key References**: Fang 2011; Sailaja 2013; Li et al., Nat. Chem., 2022 (NIR photocages) [Li 2022].  
   Modifications: Added NIR secondary trigger, improved safety, new citation.
