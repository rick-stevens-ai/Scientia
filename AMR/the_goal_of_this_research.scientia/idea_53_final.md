# Final Report: Idea 53

## Final ELO Score: 1202.3

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Metabolic Neo-Antigen Display plus Immune Checkpoint Blockade to Clear MRSA

**Key Idea**: Azido-D-alanine labelling followed by DNP click-tagging combined with anti-PD-1 therapy boosts opsonisation and T-cell help.

**Paragraph**: Checkpoint blockade enhances humoral responses to weak neo-antigens [Saylor 2019].

**Approach**: Mouse bacteraemia with PD-1 blockade; flow cytometry of anti-DNP B-cells; survival.

**Key References**: Saylor 2019; Hong 2010; Gopalakrishnan et al., Science, 2018 (checkpoint & microbiota) [Gopalakrishnan 2018].  
    Modifications: Added checkpoint synergy; new citation.
