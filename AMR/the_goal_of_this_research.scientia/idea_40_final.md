## Final ELO Score: 1217.5

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Reversible Cyanoacrylamide Covalent Inhibitors of Sortase A with Implant-Coating Application

**Key Idea**: Surface-bound, slow-release covalent reversible inhibitors of Sortase A prevent biofilm establishment on medical implants.

**Paragraph**: Covalent reversibility limits systemic exposure yet ensures high local potency [Krishnan 2021].  Incorporation into titanium-oxide sol-gels yields self-sterilising surfaces.

**Approach**: Synthesis of surface-anchored inhibitors; QCM-D biofilm kinetics; rabbit prosthetic joint infection study.

**Key References**: Mazmanian 1999; Krishnan 2021; Campoccia et al., Biomaterials, 2021 (antibiofilm coatings) [Campoccia 2021].  
    Modifications: Added implant-coating application; new citation.
