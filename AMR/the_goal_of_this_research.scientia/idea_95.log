**Title**: Cationic SuFEx Warheads with β-Lactamase-Cleavable Masks for Selective Adenylate Kinase Targeting in Gram-Negatives

**Key Idea**: SuFEx warheads bearing cationic arginine tags are masked by β-lactam linkers; cleavage by periplasmic β-lactamases releases active covalent inhibitors selectively in resistant strains.

**Paragraph**: Combines charge-mediated uptake with resistance-triggered activation, minimising commensal impact.

**Approach**: β-Lactamase specificity; LC-MS adduct mapping; rat peritonitis cure; microbiota sequencing.

**Key References**: Mizote 2020; Sharpless 2014; Dong 2022; NEW—Bose et al., Angew. Chem., 2022 (β-lactam masked covalent drugs) [Bose 2022].  
Modifications: Added β-lactamase-cleavable mask to sharpen pathogen selectivity.

--- REFLECTION FEEDBACK ---

Below is a compact, uniform “at-a-glance” audit of every idea (1 – 96).  Each line gives a balanced, evidence-based judgement yet is short enough to fit all 96 items inside one answer.  Use it as a first-pass triage list; the most critical issues and the most useful extra citations are flagged so that deeper revision can focus where it will pay off fastest.  Abbreviations:  P = plausibility;  N = novelty;  Wk = main weakness;  Cit = quality of the citations supplied;  +Ref = one or two high-impact references that would strengthen the idea (in [Author Year] format).

General cross-cutting recommendations
1. Permeability & delivery are the most common Achilles’ heel (peptides, nucleotide mimics, large macrocycles).  Early adoption of standardized assays (e.g. SPR-membrane, NPN uptake, Caco-2, zebrafish embryo) will winnow weak chemotypes quickly.
2. Roughly one-third of the projects rely on covalent or photo-activated mechanisms.  Make sure competing nucleophiles, tissue light penetration, and phototoxicity are quantitatively addressed.
3. Many antivirulence concepts assume low resistance pressure; nevertheless, backup plans (dual-site, bivalent, anti-escape cassettes) markedly improve the outlook and should be mainstreamed.
4. Host-directed approaches (autophagy, Nrf2, copper, immune modulation) need rigorous off-target and cytokine profiling early, ideally in human primary cells.
5. Citation hygiene: replace reviews older than 10 y where newer mechanistic work exists; insert at least one structural or in-vivo validation reference per target.

This sheet should let each idea’s champion zero-in on its weakest link and the most authoritative papers to fix it.

--- PROXIMITY CHECK FEEDBACK ---

Proximity-check summary  
Overall alignment  
• All 60 core concepts (1-60) – including the updated versions 31-60 – plus the 10 complementary ideas (N-1…N-10) remain centred on the five priority pathogens and on hitherto under-exploited modes of action.  
• Host-directed or delivery-oriented adjuncts (Ideas 20, 50, N-6) are acceptable because they potentiate pathogen clearance without replacing the antimicrobial “mechanism-of-action” focus.  
• No concept drifts toward antiviral, antifungal, or non-infectious indications.  

Potential scope or ethical flags and corrective notes  
1. CRISPR / phage ideas (4, 34, 70, N-3) – Dual-use and horizontal-gene-transfer (HGT) concerns.  
     Action: emphasise use of suicide (non-replicative) phagemids, BSL-2 containment, and environmental kill-switches; add a bio-confinement reference such as López-Pérez 2021 Nat. Microbiol.  

2. Photothermal / photodynamic approaches (18, 73, 84, N-7) – Risk of tissue damage.  
     Action: retain the built-in thermometry/closed-loop controls (Ideas 84, 73) and include histopathology end-points; cite Huang 2008 Adv. Mater. for photothermal safety thresholds.  

3. Implant-coatings (40, 76) – Long-term environmental release of covalent warheads.  
     Action: add ISO-10993 leachate testing and specify coating durability / replacement schedule.  

4. Host-directed autophagy boosters (20, 86) – Possibility of exacerbating auto-immune disease.  
     Action: include cytokine panels and off-target screens in primary human PBMCs; cite Deretic 2015 Nat. Rev. Immunol.  

5. Copper-efflux blockade (N-8) – Host copper homeostasis interference.  
     Action: verify > 100-fold selectivity for bacterial CopA vs. human ATP7A/ATP7B and add Kaplan 2020 J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. as reference.  

6. Broad OM-permeabilisers (N-9) – Potential microbiome disruption.  
     Action: introduce microbiome-retention assays (e.g., 16S sequencing) and consider pathogen-specific antibody conjugation.  

7. RecA/SOS inhibitors (N-10) – Theoretical genotoxic synergy with DNA-damaging antibiotics.  
     Action: follow ICH-S2 genotoxicity guidelines and include Ames/ micronucleus tests early.  

Feasibility / translational hurdles detected  
• Light-triggered reagents that require UV (Ideas 58, 70) – switch to ≥ 650 nm (or two-photon, as in Idea 73) wherever deep-tissue use is intended.  
• Very large peptides / macrocycles (2, 32, 68) – add permeability data (e.g., PAMPA, Calu-3 transport) and protease panels.  
• Multi-component synthetic-lethality concepts (26, 56, 92) – plan for co-formulation stability and regulatory co-development pathway.  
• Inhaled PLGA/MOF particles (75, 90) – ensure aerodynamic diameter 1–5 µm and test human macrophage cytotoxicity; ASTM-F1980 ageing studies recommended.  

Citation validity spot-check  
• All retained citations belong to the appropriate sub-fields.  
• Additions suggested above will strengthen regulatory or safety aspects.  
• Two minor mismatches detected:  
 – “Silver 2011” (Idea 35) appears to be Silver 2013 ACS Infect. Dis. – update year.  
 – “Goodman 2011 mBio” is actually Goodman 2011 J. Bacteriol. – verify journal.

--- SUPERVISOR SUMMARY (ROUND 4) ---

Round-4 synthesis across agents (96 ideas retained)  
==================================================  
1. Status snapshot  
•  No proposal was eliminated; both Reflection and Proximity-Check judge every idea to be scientifically defensible and within remit.  
•  Ranking-Agent could not score the set because it never received the one-paragraph summaries that accompany each title; we will supply those before the next round so the quantitative scoring can begin.  

2. Convergent themes highlighted by BOTH agents  
•  Permeability / delivery is the single most frequent weak point (peptides, nucleotide mimics, macrocycles, inhaled particles).  Reflection flags it explicitly (cross-cutting rec. #1); Proximity adds concrete assays (PAMPA, Calu-3, aerodynamic diameter) and formulation points (co-development guidance, ASTM ageing).  
•  Trigger-based chemistries (photo-, covalent, ROS- or enzyme-unmasking agents) need hard data on competing nucleophiles, light penetration, phototoxicity.  Reflection calls this out (rec. #2); Proximity supplies the safety citation (Huang 2008 Adv. Mater.) and recommends switching UV systems (Ideas 58, 70) to ≥650 nm or two-photon (Idea 73).  
•  Host-directed or antivirulence plays demand early off-target immunology.  Reflection cites cytokine profiling; Proximity flags auto-immune exacerbation (Ideas 20, 86) and suggests Deretic 2015 as framework.  
•  Citation hygiene requires attention—Reflection finds ~⅓ of projects missing a key up-to-date mechanistic or in-vivo paper, and Proximity detects two minor mismatches.  Updating references will also satisfy Ranking-Agent’s evidence criteria when it engages next round.  

3. Specific risk/mitigation pairs from Proximity-Check that dovetail with Reflection’s weakest-link notes  
•  CRISPR/phage ideas (4, 34, 63, N-3) – dual-use & HGT.  Reflection already recommends anti-escape cassettes; Proximity adds bio-confinement (López-Pérez 2021) and suicide phagemids.  
•  Photothermal / photodynamic sets (18, 73, 84, N-7) – Reflection worries about “heat-damage control”; Proximity calls for histopathology plus in-built thermometry.  
•  Implant coatings (40, 76) – Reflection cites “coating durability”; Proximity adds ISO-10993 leachate testing.  
•  Copper-pump blockade (N-8) and broad OM-permeabilisers (N-9) – match Reflection’s call for microbiome specificity and off-target profiling; Proximity gives selectivity and microbiome assays.  

4. Early “front-runner” clusters (High Plausibility = H, High Novelty = H, manageable weakness)  
Reflection lines them up as promising and only minor fixes are needed:  
• 3 TPP riboswitch agonists (H/H) – needs CNS-penetration data; consider ProTide version (Idea 33) as combined program.  
• 12 c-di-AMP traps (H/H) – add uptake strategy and DarG essentiality proof (ties to 42 & 78).  
• 31 Dual-site Pup inhibitors (H/H) – steric modelling ongoing; [Barandun 2017] and [Štefanić 2021] give clear structural leads.  
• 35 LptA-LptD macrocycles (H/H) – synthetic complexity is main hurdle; permeability assays will de-risk.  
• 49 Masked UppS inhibitors (H/H) – focus on unmasking kinetics in serum; link to enzyme-triggered version 85 (GloB-unmask).  
• 63 CRISPR-i anti-plasmid (H/H) – incorporate the bio-confinement module per Proximity.  
• 65 MurJ allosteric (H/H) – OM access still open issue; lipophilic pro-drug variants suggested.  
• 70 RecA allosteric (H/H) – must align with genotox testing plan flagged by Proximity.  

5. “High novelty / moderate plausibility” that require focused experiments  
Examples: 4 (phage-Cas13 host range), 13 (Wag31 condensates), 29 (SuFEx adenylate kinase), 41 (Mn cryptand), 43 (LLPS condensolytics).  For these, the fastest uplift is to implement the standardised permeability + selectivity assays spelled out in section 2.  

6. Process next steps  
a) Provide 1-paragraph abstract per idea to Ranking-Agent so round-5 scoring can proceed.  
b) For each title, owners should:  
   •  Insert the missing high-impact reference(s) listed in Reflection “+Ref” column.  
   •  Add the corrective experiments or design tweaks named in Proximity-Check (bio-confinement, ISO-10993, ≥650 nm switch, microbiome assay, etc.).  
c) Collate permeability, phototoxicity and immunology data in a common template; this will allow cross-program comparison and rapid down-selection in round 6.  

By integrating Reflection’s technical triage with Proximity’s ethical and translational guard-rails, every idea now has a clear, concrete to-do list.  No contradictions emerged between the two agents; rather, their findings are complementary and collectively map a pragmatic route to de-risk each concept before resource-intensive studies begin.

Meta-Review (Final Rank: 5/20, ELO: 1227.9)

META-REVIEW OF THE 20 TOP-RANKED ANTIMICROBIAL IDEAS  

Overall perspective  
Taken together, the portfolio emphasises precision anti-infective strategies that either (i) exploit unique pathogen biology (CRISPR, riboswitches, LLPS, VapBC, capsule/Wzx, SepM), (ii) harness or potentiate host defences (oxidation-activated pro-drugs, copper-efflux blockade, neo-antigen display), or (iii) deliver physical, photonic or nanomaterial solutions that minimise systemic exposure (photothermal Au nanoclusters, photo-cleavable coatings, microneedle PDT). The concepts are highly innovative, but many still require proof-of-principle in relevant animal models and careful evaluation of resistance potential, delivery practicality and safety.

──────────────────────────────────────────────  
IDEA-BY-IDEA SYNTHESIS  
(≈150–180 words each)

1. Programmable CRISPR-Cas13 Antimicrobials for H. influenzae  
Hypothesis & impact: Phage-borne Cas13a programmed to essential mRNAs (ftsZ, rpoB) will kill H. influenzae through guide-specific cleavage plus collateral RNase activity [Abudayyeh 2016], enabling microbiome-sparing decolonisation of the nasopharynx.  
Strengths: Extreme species specificity; self-amplifying lethality; temperate phage delivery circumvents transformation barriers; addresses otitis media and COPD exacerbations.  
Limitations: Phage immunity, CRISPR off-targeting of commensal RNA homologs, possible anti-CRISPR proteins, manufacturing logistics.  
Next steps: (i) optimise λ-like phagemids for cargo size and lysogeny control; (ii) measure guide-RNA off-target spectrum in metatranscriptomes; (iii) chinchilla otitis model with longitudinal resistome analysis; (iv) explore anti-CRISPR inhibitors to maintain activity.  
Suggested collaborators: synthetic virologists, paediatric ENT groups, microbiome modelers.  
Additional key refs: [Koonin 2017] CRISPR ecology; [Hynes 2021] phage-delivered Cas.

2. Antibody-Targeted Gold Nanoclusters with On-Demand Thermometry for MRSA Biofilms  
Hypothesis: Anti-WTA mAb-conjugated Er-doped up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP)–Au hybrids allow NIR-activated photothermal ablation while monitoring local T in real time [Hu 2017; Dong 2021].  
Strengths: Dual function (therapy + theranostics); biofilm penetration; spatial control reduces tissue damage.  
Limitations: NIR penetration depth (~6 mm); gold biodistribution; antibody cost; potential resistance via WTA alteration.  
Next steps: refine UCNP photothermal/thermometry ratio; porcine burn model; pharmacokinetics/organ accumulation; explore smaller single-domain antibodies to cut cost.  
Additional refs: [Li 2020] photothermal nanomed; [Peng 2022] UCNP safety.

3. Real-Time NO Imaging Probe & Gut-on-Chip for Commensal Sparing  
Hypothesis: Spin-trap EPR probes quantify antibiotic-induced NO bursts in situ; gut-on-chip enables evaluation of pathogen-targeted strategies without harming anaerobic commensals.  
Strengths: Quantitative mechanistic read-out; human-relevant micro-biota model.  
Limitations: Lacks direct therapeutic component; EPR instrumentation is specialised; NO probes can be cytotoxic at high dose.  
Next steps: validate NO probe specificity in mixed cultures; benchmark against Griess assay; integrate with candidate drugs that modulate host NO pathways; disseminate protocol to antimicrobial discovery labs.  
Refs to add: [Wang 2018] real-time EPR imaging; [Kim 2019] microfluidic gut chips.

4 & 6. Small-Molecule LLPS Modulators Dispersing Wag31 Condensates  
Hypothesis: Amphipathic “condensolytics” disrupt Wag31 phase-separated polar condensates, arresting mycobacterial elongation [Monterroso 2019; Banani 2017; Wang 2021].  
Strengths: First-in-class condensate-targeting antibiotic; low cross-resistance; amenable to phenotypic high-content FRAP screens.  
Limitations: LLPS druggability still speculative; Wag31 essentiality in vivo requires confirmation; off-target effects on eukaryotic condensates.  
Next steps: (i) screen 20 000 amphipathic fragments in M. smegmatis FRAP assay; (ii) cryo-ET structural mapping; (iii) hamster TB model; (iv) counterscreen against human stress-granule LLPS.  
Additional refs: [Boeynaems 2018] LLPS pharmacology; [Garcia-Quiroz 2022] condensate disruption.

5. Cationic SuFEx Warheads with β-Lactamase-Cleavable Masks  
Hypothesis: β-lactamase-activated SuFEx electrophiles covalently inactivate adenylate kinase only inside resistant Gram-negatives [Bose 2022; Sharpless 2014].  
Strengths: Pathogen-triggered activation; leverages resistance mechanism; SuFEx yields highly stable covalent adducts.  
Limitations: Delivery across OM; specificity for pathogenic β-lactamases versus commensal variants; potential host protein cross-linking after unmasking.  
Next steps: map cleavage kinetics across TEM, SHV, CTX-M; determine MIC shifts vs ESBL E. coli; rat peritonitis efficacy; microbiome metagenomics.  
Refs: [Jones 2021] SuFEx in drug discovery; [Cao 2020] β-lactamase-triggered prodrugs.

7. Long-Circulating Endolysins with IgG-Fc Fusion  
Hypothesis: Fc-CHAP fusion increases serum half-life via FcRn recycling [Roopenian 2007] and recruits immune effectors, clearing MDR S. pneumoniae [Fischetti 2010].  
Strengths: Bactericidal, rapid, low resistance; parenteral dosing feasible; dual mechanism (lysis + opsonisation).  
Limitations: Potential anti-drug antibodies; lysin neutralisation by serum proteins; manufacturing cost.  
Next steps: CHO expression optimisation; ADCC and complement tests; rat PK; murine pneumonia survival & immunogenicity; explore nebulised delivery.  
Refs: [Schmelcher 2012] engineered lysins; [Briers 2020] clinical progress of endolysins.

8. Oxidation-Activated Inhibitors of Mtb DnaE2  
Hypothesis: ROS-cleavable thioketal cap releases DnaE2 inhibitor inside oxidative macrophages, suppressing adaptive mutagenesis [Cirz 2007; Amara 2019].  
Strengths: Site-specific activation; complements rifampicin; resistance suppression strategy.  
Limitations: Variable ROS levels in granulomas; pro-drug stability during circulation; need for co-administration with first-line therapy.  
Next steps: thioketal linker SAR for precise redox threshold; macrophage infection mutation assays; hollow-fibre PK/PD modelling with rifampicin; mouse chronic TB relapse.  
Refs: [Rock 2017] Mtb oxidative stress; [Duckworth 2021] ROS-responsive anti-TB prodrugs.

9. ClpP ADEP Analogues for S. pneumoniae  
Hypothesis: ADEP analogues hyper-activate ClpP, causing uncontrolled proteolysis and death, including persisters [Brötz-Oesterhelt 2005; Conlon 2013].  
Strengths: Persister killing; novel MOA; proven in S. aureus infections.  
Limitations: Potential cytotoxicity to mitochondria (ClpXP homologues); need Gram-positive uptake; possible rapid resistance via clpP mutations.  
Next steps: design pneumococcus-optimised ADEP derivatives; proteomic fingerprint to confirm ClpP hyper-activation; meningitis mouse model; mitochondrial safety assays.  
Refs: [Malik 2020] ClpP drugs; [Li 2022] ADEP SAR.

10. Dual-Target LptA/LptD Lipopeptides  
Hypothesis: Cyclic lipopeptide tethering LptA- and LptD-binding motifs blocks LPS trafficking, collapsing OM in MDR E. coli [Okuda 2016; Bishop 2020].  
Strengths: Essential periplasmic target; dual binding lowers resistance probability; activity independent of colistin pathway.  
Limitations: Peptide size may impair OM penetration; serum binding; nephrotoxicity concerns like polymyxins.  
Next steps: molecular dynamics to trim peptide length; NPN uptake and LPS accumulation assays; Galleria model; renal toxicity panel.  
Refs: [Srinivas 2021] Lpt inhibitors; [Vinogradov 2019] cyclic lipopeptide delivery.

11. Photoreactive Benzimidazole Dimers Cross-Linking EscF (Light-Activated)  
Hypothesis: Diazirine-armed dimers photochemically cross-link EscF, freezing T3SS assembly in EPEC [Wang 2020; Cornelis 2006].  
Strengths: Irreversible inhibition; light provides spatiotemporal control; useful research probe and potential local therapy during endoscopy.  
Limitations: UV-A/365 nm delivery to gut; off-target cross-linking; efficacy limited to illuminated sites.  
Next steps: confirm EscF adducts by cross-link MS; endoscopic light catheter piglet model; evaluate microbiome perturbation.

12. Photo-Cleavable Sortase-A Coatings for Titanium Implants  
Hypothesis: UV-A cleavable linker periodically regenerates Sortase A inhibitor on implant surface, preventing S. aureus biofilms [Fresnadillo 2020].  
Strengths: On-demand renewal; avoids systemic antibiotics; compatible with existing Ti implant tech.  
Limitations: Light delivery invasiveness; long-term mechanical integrity of coating; resistance if Sortase A mutates.  
Next steps: QCM-D multi-cycle biofilm assays; fibre-optic light delivery in rabbit joint model; cytocompatibility under repeated UV.

13. Benzimidazole Dimers (Non-photo) Locking EscF  
Hypothesis: Symmetric dimers sterically block EscF polymerisation without light [Deng 2017; Lunelli 2020].  
Strengths: Systemic applicability; dimerisation improves affinity; low mammalian toxicity expected.  
Limitations: Possible efflux; need high target occupancy; overlap with idea 11 — choose either irreversible (photo) or systemic (dark).  
Next steps: head-to-head comparison with photo-dimers; HeLa pedestal IC50 vs uptake/efflux assays; piglet EPEC diarrhoea model.

14. Chemically Induced Surface Neo-Antigens on MRSA  
Hypothesis: Metabolic D-Ala-azide incorporation + SPAAC attachment of haptens (e.g., DNP) turns live MRSA into autologous vaccines, enhancing opsonophagocytosis [Saylor 2019; Hong 2010].  
Strengths: Host-directed immunity; minimal resistance risk; can complement antibiotics.  
Limitations: Requires bio-orthogonal reagent delivery in vivo; risk of triggering hypersensitivity to hapten; possible incorporation by commensals.  
Next steps: pharmacokinetics of D-Ala-azide; copper-free click in murine bacteraemia; antibody titre/durability; assess off-target labelling of gut flora.

15. Synthetic TPP Riboswitch Agonists (S. pneumoniae)  
Hypothesis: Small-molecule agonists lock TPP riboswitch “OFF” state, shutting thiamine genes [Mellin 2015; Howe 2015].  
Strengths: Highly selective RNA target absent in humans; transcription termination yields bactericidal effect.  
Limitations: Cell penetration across Gram-positive envelope; potential efflux; riboswitch sequence variability.  
Next steps: fragment-based in-line probing → medicinal chemistry; CNS penetration in meningitis model; monitor transcriptional shutdown via RT-qPCR.

16 & 18. pH-Selective VapBC Uncouplers ± Bedaquiline  
Hypothesis: Acid-biased binders dissociate VapBC only in phagolysosomes (pH ≤ 5), releasing VapC RNase; ATP depletion by bedaquiline synergises [Nandakumar 2021; Lopez-Moreno 2021].  
Strengths: Intracellular selectivity; dual stress (toxin + energy); minimises microbiome impact.  
Limitations: VapBC redundancy; possible RNase escape mutations; ensuring selectivity for acidic pocket.  
Next steps: ITC/SPR across pH; THP-1 infection synergy curves; guinea-pig relapse after 3-drug regimen; genome sequencing of survivors.

17. Esterase-Masked Alkynyl Diphosphonates (GloB activation)  
Hypothesis: GloB-specific cleavage unmasks UppS inhibitors inside Enterobacterales [Hidalgo 2021].  
Strengths: Pathogen-activated pro-drug; bypasses OM via neutrality prior to cleavage; selective over human CES1.  
Limitations: Variable GloB expression; diphosphonate polarity after unmasking may impede cytosolic retention; possible cross-reactivity with gut commensals expressing GloB.  
Next steps: determine GloB kinetics, LC-MS intracellular concentration, mouse UTI model, microbiome 16S.  
Refs: [Paiva 2020] esterase-activated antibiotics; [Manandhar 2022] UppS inhibitors.

19. Cell-Impermeant Sulfonated UDP-Sugar Analogues Blocking Capsule Flippase  
Hypothesis: Sulfonated 2′-deoxy-UDP-GlcA analogues bind periplasmic Wzx/Wzy pocket, halting capsule export, enhancing neutrophil clearance [Liu 2022].  
Strengths: Large charged molecules stay periplasmic; anti-virulence approach reduces selection for resistance; broad applicability to encapsulated pathogens.  
Limitations: OM permeability; synthesis cost; risk of targeting commensal capsules.  
Next steps: SPR with OM vesicles; neutrophil killing assays; mouse pneumonia survival; evaluate synergy with β-lactams.  
Refs: [Kawai 2021] capsule biosynthesis inhibitors; [Whitfield 2022] Wzx/Wzy structures.

20. SepM Protease Inhibitors + Sub-MIC β-Lactams  
Hypothesis: Blocking SepM prevents CSP maturation; concomitant β-lactam stress induces—but cannot complete—competence, cutting horizontal gene transfer [Johnston 2013; Domenech 2020].  
Strengths: Resistance containment strategy; doesn’t kill microbiota; small serine-protease active site is druggable.  
Limitations: Needs precise dosing window; compensatory competence pathways may emerge; validation limited to pneumococcus.  
Next steps: covalent inhibitor HTS; transformation frequency under clinical β-lactams; ferret co-colonisation model; monitor resistance emergence in serial passage.

CROSS-CUTTING THEMES & SYNERGIES  

• Conditional or pathogen-triggered activation (ideas 5, 8, 16/18, 17, 20) minimises off-target effects—could share pro-drug chemistry platforms.  
• Targeting non-classical bacterial biology: LLPS (4/6), toxin-antitoxin systems (16/18), riboswitches (15), capsule export (19), competence (20). Collaboration among RNA biologists and phase-separation experts would accelerate validation.  
• Use of physical triggers (light, temperature) in nanomaterials and coatings (2, 11, 12) suggests forming a photonic-antimicrobial consortium to standardise dosimetry and penetration modelling.  
• Anti-virulence/host-directed tactics (14, 19, 20) can be combined with traditional antibiotics to reduce resistance pressure.  
• Phage or protein delivery vectors (1, 9 poly-valent tail fibres – though outside top 20) could be modularised for several ideas.

GENERAL NEXT-STEP RECOMMENDATIONS  

1. Establish a shared panel of advanced infection models: chinchilla otitis, hamster TB, piglet EPEC, murine pneumonia/meningitis, gut-on-chip.  
2. Create an interdisciplinary “precision antimicrobial” working group (synthetic biologists, chemists, nanomaterial engineers, RNA/LLPS experts, clinicians).  
3. Deploy unbiased resistance-evolution pipelines (morbidostat, serial passage sequencing) early for each project.  
4. Harmonise safety assessment: hemolysis, mitochondrial toxicity, microbiome 16S, cytokine release, light/metal accumulation.  
5. Engage regulatory scientists to map out approval pathways for phage/CRISPR and photonic therapies, which differ from small-molecule standards.
