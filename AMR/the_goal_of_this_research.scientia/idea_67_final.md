## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Cell-Penetrant Dual-Site Inhibitors of the Pup-Proteasome that Illuminate Target Engagement

**Key Idea**: A bivalent boronate–isoquinoline conjugate that blocks both the PafA active cysteine and Pup-binding groove, delivered as an ethyl-carbonate pro-drug, will shut down proteasomal quality control and allow in-vivo PET imaging of pathway inhibition.

**Paragraph**: Although the earlier dual-site concept increased resistance barriers, intracellular delivery and real-time verification remained open questions.  Masking the phenolic boronate with an ethyl-carbonate boosts passive uptake and is cleaved by Mtb esterases, while a terminal ¹⁸F label on the isoquinoline enables PET imaging of drug distribution and target occupancy inside granulomas.  Probe-confirmed engagement will de-risk clinical translation and guide dosing.

**Approach**: (i) Synthesize ethyl-carbonate pro-drugs; (ii) measure esterase-triggered unmasking (LC-MS); (iii) PET/CT in infected C3HeB/FeJ mice to correlate lung signal with degradome shutdown; (iv) relapse study with isoniazid ± inhibitor.

What Was Modified & Why: Added ethyl-carbonate pro-drug for permeability, ¹⁸F PET tag for engagement confirmation, and esterase-specific release—addressing delivery and validation gaps.

### Key Idea

### Detailed Explanation

Although the earlier dual-site concept increased resistance barriers, intracellular delivery and real-time verification remained open questions.  Masking the phenolic boronate with an ethyl-carbonate boosts passive uptake and is cleaved by Mtb esterases, while a terminal ¹⁸F label on the isoquinoline enables PET imaging of drug distribution and target occupancy inside granulomas.  Probe-confirmed engagement will de-risk clinical translation and guide dosing.

### Implementation Approach
