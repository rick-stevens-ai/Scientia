# Final Report: Idea 42

## Final ELO Score: 1206.5

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Suicide-Substrate Ribosyl Mimics that Trap MRSA DarG and Drain c-di-AMP

**Key Idea**: Reactive ribose analogues form covalent adducts with DarG, irreversibly diverting c-di-AMP and weakening cell wall integrity synergistically with β-lactams.

**Paragraph**: Covalent tethers reduce efflux susceptibility and confer long intracellular residence [Devaux 2020].

**Approach**: Warhead design via electrophilic sugar analogues; whole-cell K+ flux; β-lactam synergy checkerboards; murine sepsis.

**Key References**: Corrigan 2013; Devaux 2020; Rosenberg et al., Nat. Chem. Biol., 2022 (covalent sugar inhibitors) [Rosenberg 2022].  
    Modifications: Shifted to covalent “suicide” approach; new citation.
