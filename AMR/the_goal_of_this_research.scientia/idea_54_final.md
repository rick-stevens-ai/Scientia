# Final Report: Idea 54

## Final ELO Score: 1189.9

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Fragment-Growing Inhibitors of GlgE with Lung-Resident Aerosol Formulation

**Key Idea**: Inhalable dry-powder GlgE inhibitors achieve high pulmonary exposure, disrupting trehalose-α-glucan metabolism essential for TB persistence.

**Paragraph**: Direct lung delivery reduces systemic toxicity [Leiba 2013].

**Approach**: Fragment growing; MAS-DPI aerosol characterisation; mouse aerosol TB.

**Key References**: Kalscheuer 2010; Leiba 2013; Pilcer & Amighi, Int. J. Pharm., 2010 (dry powders) [Pilcer 2010].  
    Modifications: Added inhalable formulation; new citation.
