## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Click-Derived Macrocyclic Lipopeptide Library Bridging LptA–LptD to Derail LPS Transport

**Key Idea**: A library of azide–alkyne cyclised lipo-macrocycles optimised by DNA-encoded chemistry screens will identify highly permeable dual-binders that stall LptA–LptD assembly.

**Paragraph**: Prior single-compound design risks missing best chemotypes.  DNA-encoded libraries (DEL) enrich for binders against immobilised LptA & LptD, followed by structural filtering for membrane permeability, producing candidates resilient to resistance.

**Approach**: Parallel DEL selections; surface-plasmon confirmation; OM permeability; colistin-resistant E. coli mouse sepsis combo therapy.

**Key References**: Okuda 2016; Bishop 2020; Silver 2011; NEW—Goodnow et al., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov., 2022 (DEL for macrocycles) [Goodnow 2022].  
Modifications: Introduced DEL-guided diversity and permeability triage, overcoming SAR blind spots.
