**Title**: In Situ Evolution of Crop Microbiomes via Adaptive Laboratory Evolution

**Key Idea**: Directing in situ evolution of crop-associated microbiomes under controlled drought selection can yield communities optimized for stress tolerance.

**Paragraph**: Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) has been widely used in microbes but not for whole plant-microbiome systems [Kawecki 2012]. This

**Approach**: could yield robust, drought-adapted microbiomes.  
**Approach**: Grow crops with complex microbiomes under progressive drought selection, transplant microbiomes to new plants, and assess improvement in yield and drought resistance.
