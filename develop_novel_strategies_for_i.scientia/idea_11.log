**Title**: Modulating Plant Immune Responses to Foster Beneficial Microbe Recruitment

**Key Idea**: Downregulation of specific plant immune receptors can facilitate colonization by beneficial drought-tolerant microbes without increasing disease susceptibility.

**Paragraph**: Plant immune systems can inadvertently exclude beneficial microbes [Lebeis 2015]. Fine-tuning immune response pathways may allow beneficial colonization while maintaining defense.

**Approach**: Use CRISPR/Cas9 to downregulate specific pattern recognition receptors, monitor microbiome shifts, and assess plant health and drought resistance.

**Key References**: Lebeis, S.L. et al., "Salicylic acid modulates colonization of the root microbiome by specific bacterial taxa," Science, 2015.
