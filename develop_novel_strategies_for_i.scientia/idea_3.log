**Title**: CRISPR-based Editing of Root Microbiome Assembly Genes in Crops

**Key Idea**: Editing plant genes that control root exudate profiles can selectively recruit beneficial microbes, improving drought resistance and yield.

**Paragraph**: Root exudates shape the rhizosphere microbiome, influencing plant health and stress responses [Sasse 2018]. CRISPR can be used to modulate exudate composition, thus engineering the microbiome indirectly through the plant.

**Approach**: Identify genes controlling exudate biosynthesis, engineer crop lines with altered exudate profiles, and profile rhizosphere microbiomes and plant performance under drought.

**Key References**: Sasse, J. et al., "Feed your friends: do plant exudates shape the root microbiome?" Trends Plant Sci., 2018.
