**Title**: Engineering Synthetic Microbial Consortia for Enhanced Drought Tolerance

**Key Idea**: Synthetic, multi-strain microbial consortia can outperform single-strain inoculants in promoting crop yield and drought resistance.

**Paragraph**: Engineered consortia composed of complementary microbes may synergistically enhance plant growth under drought by mediating nutrient uptake, phytohormone production, and stress signaling pathways. While single-strain plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) often show inconsistent results in the field, consortia can stabilize functional outputs and adapt to environmental variability [Niu 2017].

**Approach**: Construct consortia of well-characterized PGPB with complementary drought-mitigating functions, test their effects on crop yield and drought tolerance in greenhouse and field trials, and analyze plant physiological responses.
