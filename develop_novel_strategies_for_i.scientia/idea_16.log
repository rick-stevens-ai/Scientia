**Title**: Manipulating Microbial Siderophore Production to Enhance Nutrient Uptake

**Key Idea**: Enhanced microbial siderophore production in the rhizosphere can increase plant iron acquisition and improve drought tolerance.

**Paragraph**: Iron availability is often reduced in dry soils; siderophore-producing microbes can increase iron solubility, supporting plant health under drought [Ahmed 2014].

**Approach**: Select or engineer high-siderophore-producing rhizobacteria, apply to crops, and measure iron uptake, growth, and yield under drought.
