**Title**: Harnessing Endophytic Bacteria for Improved Water Use Efficiency

**Key Idea**: Inoculation with specific endophytic bacteria can enhance water use efficiency (WUE) in major crops under drought stress.

**Paragraph**: Endophytes can modulate plant physiology directly from within tissues, often producing phytohormones or osmoprotectants that help plants retain water and maintain growth during drought [Compant 2010]. Targeting WUE via endophyte engineering presents a promising and underexplored avenue.

**Approach**: Isolate and characterize endophytes from drought-tolerant wild relatives, inoculate into crop plants, and measure WUE, yield, and stress-responsive gene expression under controlled drought.
