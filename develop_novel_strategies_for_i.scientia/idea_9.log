**Title**: Exploiting Quorum Sensing Interference to Enhance Plant Drought Tolerance

**Key Idea**: Manipulating microbial quorum sensing in the rhizosphere can shift community composition toward beneficial, drought-adaptive taxa.

**Paragraph**: Quorum sensing regulates microbial community structure and plant interaction [Hartmann 2014]. Interfering with deleterious signaling can favor beneficial microbes under drought.

**Approach**: Apply quorum-sensing inhibitors or mimics to the rhizosphere, monitor microbial community shifts, and assess impacts on plant drought tolerance and yield.
