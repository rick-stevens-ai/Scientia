**Title**: Deploying Diazotrophic Bacteria to Reduce Fertilizer Dependence in Drought-prone Systems

**Key Idea**: Inoculation with nitrogen-fixing bacteria can maintain yield under drought while reducing fertilizer requirements.

**Paragraph**: Diazotrophic bacteria provide a sustainable nitrogen source, and their benefits may be amplified under drought if combined with microbes that also promote drought tolerance [Rouws 2014].

**Approach**: Test co-inoculation of diazotrophs and drought-tolerance PGPB in field trials, measuring yield, N uptake, and soil moisture under reduced irrigation and fertilizer regimes.
