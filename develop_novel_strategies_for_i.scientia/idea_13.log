**Title**: Utilizing Cyanobacteria for Soil Surface Microbiome Engineering in Drylands

**Key Idea**: Cyanobacterial inoculation can improve soil water retention, fertility, and plant yield in arid agricultural systems.

**Paragraph**: Cyanobacteria form biological soil crusts, enhancing soil structure and water retention [Chamizo 2018]. Their introduction into croplands may benefit plant water status and yield.

**Approach**: Inoculate soils with selected cyanobacteria, monitor soil moisture dynamics, fertility, and crop yield under drought.

**Key References**: Chamizo, S. et al., "Biological soil crusts in dryland ecosystems: their role as carbon and nitrogen sinks and drivers of soil fertility," Front. Microbiol., 2018.
