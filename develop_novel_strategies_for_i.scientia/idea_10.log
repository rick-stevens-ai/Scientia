**Title**: Engineering Microbial Production of Plant Osmoprotectants

**Key Idea**: Engineered rhizobacteria producing osmoprotectants such as proline or glycine betaine can enhance host plant drought resistance.

**Paragraph**: Microbial production of osmoprotectants can be transferred to the plant, increasing cell turgor and survival under drought [Yang 2009]. Synthetic biology can boost this function in key rhizobacteria.

**Approach**: Engineer key rhizobacteria with osmoprotectant biosynthesis pathways, inoculate crops, and measure osmolyte accumulation and drought performance.
