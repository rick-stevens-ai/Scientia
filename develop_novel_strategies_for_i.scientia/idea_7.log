**Title**: Soil Microbiome Transplantation from Drought-Resilient Ecosystems

**Key Idea**: Transplanting entire soil microbiomes from drought-resilient ecosystems can confer increased drought tolerance to recipient crops.

**Paragraph**: Soil microbiome transplantation has shown promise in disease suppression and environmental adaptation [Wubs 2016]. Applying this

**Approach**: for drought resilience is an unexplored direction.  
**Approach**: Transfer microbiomes from arid-adapted soils to agricultural fields, monitor crop yield, microbiome succession, and drought tolerance.
