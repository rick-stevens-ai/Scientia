**Title**: Designer Microbial Biofilms for Root Surface Protection and Moisture Retention

**Key Idea**: Engineering microbial biofilms on root surfaces can create a protective microenvironment that conserves moisture and supports plant growth during drought.

**Paragraph**: Biofilm-forming rhizobacteria can alter root hydration and protect against desiccation [Vurukonda 2018]. Designing robust, beneficial biofilms could be a novel drought adaptation strategy.

**Approach**: Engineer or select biofilm-forming PGPB, inoculate roots, assess biofilm stability, root hydration, and yield under water-deficit conditions.
