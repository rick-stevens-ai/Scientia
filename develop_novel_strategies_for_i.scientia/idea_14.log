**Title**: Engineering Plant Root Architecture via Microbiome Manipulation

**Key Idea**: Manipulating the microbiome to promote deeper or more branched root systems can enhance drought resistance and yield.

**Paragraph**: Rhizosphere microbes can shape root growth patterns and architecture [Fitzpatrick 2020]. Engineering the microbiome to alter root systems can increase water uptake from deeper soil layers.

**Approach**: Identify and apply microbes that secrete growth regulators influencing root architecture, and assess impacts on root traits and yield under drought.
