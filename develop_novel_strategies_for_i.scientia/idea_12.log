**Title**: Targeting Microbial Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) for Plant Growth under Drought

**Key Idea**: Application of VOC-producing microbes can stimulate plant growth and drought resistance via airborne signaling.

**Paragraph**: Microbial VOCs can promote plant growth without direct contact, modulating stress responses and root architecture [Fincheira 2018].

**Approach**: Screen and apply VOC-producing microbes in soil and hydroponic systems, measure plant physiological responses and yield under drought.
