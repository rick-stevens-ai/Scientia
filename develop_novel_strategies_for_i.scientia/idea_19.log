**Title**: High-Throughput Screening for Microbes Modulating Abscisic Acid Pathways

**Key Idea**: Identifying and deploying microbes that modulate plant abscisic acid (ABA) signaling can improve plant drought response and yield.

**Paragraph**: ABA is a central hormone in drought response, and some microbes can modulate its levels or signaling [Vishwakarma 2017]. Targeted screening can identify effective strains for bioaugmentation.

**Approach**: Screen microbial collections for ABA modulation activity, inoculate crops, and measure ABA levels, drought response genes, and yield under stress.
