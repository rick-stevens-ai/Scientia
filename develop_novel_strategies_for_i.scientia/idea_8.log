**Title**: Development of Seed Coatings with Drought-Resilient Microbial Consortia

**Key Idea**: Seed coatings containing drought-adaptive microbes can enhance early seedling vigor and yield under water-limited conditions.

**Paragraph**: Seed coatings are a practical delivery method for beneficial microbes [Bargaz 2018]. Coating seeds with consortia of drought-resilient microbes may improve stand establishment and stress tolerance.

**Approach**: Formulate microbial consortia as seed coatings, evaluate effects on germination, early growth, and yield under drought in greenhouse and field.
