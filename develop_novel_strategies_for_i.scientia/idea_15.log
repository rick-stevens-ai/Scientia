**Title**: Microbiome-Based Bioremediation to Reduce Soil Salinity and Improve Drought Tolerance

**Key Idea**: Application of salt-tolerant, plant-associated microbes can reduce soil salinity, increasing crop yield and drought resistance.

**Paragraph**: High salinity often co-occurs with drought, limiting productivity. Halotolerant microbes can ameliorate salt stress and enhance plant water relations [Qadir 2014].

**Approach**: Inoculate crops with halotolerant, plant growth-promoting microbes, monitor salinity, plant water status, and yield in saline-drought conditions.
