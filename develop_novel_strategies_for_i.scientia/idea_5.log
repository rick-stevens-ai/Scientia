**Title**: Microbiome-Assisted Selection in Crop Breeding Programs

**Key Idea**: Integrating microbiome profiling into crop breeding can identify plant genotypes that recruit beneficial drought-resilient microbes.

**Paragraph**: Plant genotype influences root and rhizosphere microbiome composition, impacting stress responses [Walters 2018]. Selecting for genotypes with favorable microbiome recruitment traits can enhance drought resilience.

**Approach**: Profile microbiomes of diverse crop genotypes under drought, associate microbiome features with yield performance, and incorporate microbiome traits into breeding selection.
