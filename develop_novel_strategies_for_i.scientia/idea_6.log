**Title**: Leveraging Mycorrhizal Fungi for Improved Phosphorus Uptake and Drought Resistance

**Key Idea**: Inoculation with drought-adapted arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) improves phosphorus acquisition and water relations in crops.

**Paragraph**: AMF form symbioses with most crops, aiding nutrient uptake and increasing drought tolerance [Augé 2001]. Selecting and deploying drought-adapted AMF strains can maximize these benefits.

**Approach**: Screen AMF isolates from arid soils, inoculate crops in drought conditions, and measure P uptake, root architecture, and yield.
