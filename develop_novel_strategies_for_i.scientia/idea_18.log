**Title**: Exploiting Plant-Microbe Signaling Peptides to Enhance Symbiosis Formation

**Key Idea**: Application of microbial or synthetic signaling peptides can stimulate beneficial symbioses and boost crop drought resistance and yield.

**Paragraph**: Plant-microbe symbioses are regulated by specific signaling molecules [Oldroyd 2013]. Exogenous application may accelerate or strengthen these interactions under stress.

**Approach**: Apply purified or synthetic peptides to crops, monitor symbiosis markers, microbiome composition, and drought-related traits.
