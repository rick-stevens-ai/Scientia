## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Uncovering the Role of TP53 in Regulating the Integrated Stress Response in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates the integrated stress response to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: The integrated stress response is a cellular process that can contribute to cancer development and progression [Kang 2018]. Recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate stress responses, but the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences the integrated stress response are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in regulating the integrated stress response could reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.

**Approach**: - Analyze markers of the integrated stress response in TP53-deficient cells.
- Combine with functional assays to understand the impact on cancer development.

**Key References**: [Kang 2018, Alvarez 2019]
