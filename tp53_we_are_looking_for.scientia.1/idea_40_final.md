## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Uncovering the Role of TP53 in Regulating Non-Coding RNAs in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates non-coding RNAs to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: Non-coding RNAs play a crucial role in cancer development and progression, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate non-coding RNAs [Wang 2015]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences non-coding RNAs are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in regulating non-coding RNAs could reveal novel insights into cancer prevention and therapy.

**Approach**: - Analyze non-coding RNA expression profiles in TP53-deficient cells.

**Key References**: [Wang 2015, Li 2017, Zhang 2023]

**Refined Changes**:
