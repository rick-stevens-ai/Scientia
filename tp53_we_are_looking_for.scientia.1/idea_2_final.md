# Final Report: Idea 2

## Final ELO Score: 1491.9

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Exploring the Relationship Between TP53 and Mitochondrial Function in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates mitochondrial function and dynamics to prevent cancer development.

**Paragraph**: Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cancer, and TP53 has been shown to localize to mitochondria and regulate their function [Wang 2015]. However, the mechanisms by which TP53 influences mitochondrial dynamics and function in cancer are not well understood. Investigating the relationship between TP53 and mitochondrial function could reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.

**Approach**: Analysis of mitochondrial morphology and function in TP53-deficient cells, combined with metabolomics and proteomics.

**Key References**: [Wang 2015, Vousden 2009]
