# Final Report: Idea 15

## Final ELO Score: 1494.8

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Investigating the Role of TP53 in Regulating Apoptosis in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates apoptosis to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: Apoptosis is a crucial cellular process that can contribute to cancer development and progression [Vousden 2009]. TP53 is a key regulator of apoptosis, but the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences apoptosis are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in regulating apoptosis could reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.

**Approach**: Analysis of apoptosis markers and functional assays in TP53-deficient cells.
