## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Investigating the Relationship Between TP53 and the Immune System in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates immune responses to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: The immune system plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate immune responses [Li 2018]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences immune responses are not well understood. Investigating the relationship between TP53 and the immune system could reveal novel targets for cancer immunotherapy.

**Approach**: - Analyze immune cell populations and cytokine profiles in TP53-deficient mice.

**Key References**: [Li 2018, Scott 2017, Wang 2021]

**Refined Changes**: 
- **Simplified Approach**: Focus on key immune response assays to streamline analysis.
