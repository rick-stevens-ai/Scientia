## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Exploring the Relationship Between TP53 and DNA Repair in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates DNA repair pathways to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: DNA repair pathways play a crucial role in cancer development and progression, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate DNA repair [Alvarez 2016]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences DNA repair are not well understood. Investigating the relationship between TP53 and DNA repair could reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.

**Approach**: Analysis of DNA repair markers and functional assays in TP53-deficient cells.
