## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Investigating the Role of TP53 in Regulating RNA-Binding Protein Function in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates RNA-binding protein function to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: RNA-binding proteins play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can interact with RNA-binding proteins [Wang 2020]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences RNA-binding protein function are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in regulating RNA-binding protein function could reveal novel insights into cancer prevention and therapy.

**Approach**: - Perform RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) and functional assays to understand TP53-RNA-binding protein interactions.

**Key References**: [Wang 2020, Zhang 2019]
