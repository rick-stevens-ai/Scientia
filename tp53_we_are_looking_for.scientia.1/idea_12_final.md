## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Investigating the Role of TP53 in Regulating Inflammation in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates inflammatory responses to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: Inflammation plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate inflammatory responses [Scott 2017]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences inflammation are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in regulating inflammation could reveal novel insights into cancer prevention and therapy.

**Approach**: Analysis of inflammatory cytokine profiles and immune cell populations in TP53-deficient mice.
