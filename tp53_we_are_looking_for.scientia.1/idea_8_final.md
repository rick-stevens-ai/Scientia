## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Exploring the Relationship Between TP53 and Metabolic Reprogramming in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates metabolic reprogramming to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate metabolic pathways [Vousden 2009]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences metabolic reprogramming are not well understood. Investigating the relationship between TP53 and metabolic reprogramming could reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.

**Approach**: Metabolomics and proteomics analysis of TP53-deficient cells, combined with analysis of metabolic pathway activity.
