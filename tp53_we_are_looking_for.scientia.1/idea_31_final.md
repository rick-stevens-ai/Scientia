## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Investigating the Relationship Between TP53 and Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates SASP to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: Cellular senescence is a state of cellular stress that can contribute to cancer development and progression [Kuzmin 2018]. TP53 is a key regulator of cellular senescence, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can also regulate SASP [Jenkins 2018]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences SASP are not well understood. Investigating the relationship between TP53 and SASP could reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.

**Approach**: - Analyze SASP in TP53-deficient cells.
- Combine with RNA-seq and proteomics to understand the secretome changes.

**Key References**: [Kuzmin 2018, Jenkins 2018, Wang 2020]

**Refined Changes**: 
- **Addressing Weaknesses**: Added proteomics analysis to understand the protein-level changes in SASP.
