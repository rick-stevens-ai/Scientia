## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Uncovering the Role of TP53 in Regulating Epigenetic Inheritance in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates epigenetic inheritance to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: Epigenetic inheritance plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate epigenetic inheritance [Li 2017]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences epigenetic inheritance are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in regulating epigenetic inheritance could reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.

**Approach**: Analysis of epigenetic marks and inheritance in TP53-deficient cells, combined with RNA-seq and functional assays.
