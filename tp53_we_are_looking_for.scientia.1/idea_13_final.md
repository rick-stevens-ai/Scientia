## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Uncovering the Role of TP53 in Regulating Circadian Rhythms in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates circadian rhythms to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: Circadian rhythms play a crucial role in cancer development and progression, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate circadian rhythms [Wang 2015]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences circadian rhythms are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in regulating circadian rhythms could reveal novel targets for cancer therapy.

**Approach**: Analysis of circadian rhythm gene expression and functional assays in TP53-deficient cells.

**Key References**: [Wang 2015, Alvarez 2016]
