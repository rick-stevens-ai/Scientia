# Final Report: Idea 23

## Final ELO Score: 1533.3

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Uncovering the Role of TP53 in Regulating the Gut Microbiome

**Key Idea**: TP53 influences the gut microbiome to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression, and recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate the gut microbiome [Scott 2017]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences the gut microbiome are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in regulating the gut microbiome could reveal novel insights into cancer prevention and therapy.

**Approach**: - Perform 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics analysis of the gut microbiome in TP53-deficient mice.
- Analyze the impact on cancer development.

**Key References**: [Scott 2017, Li 2018, Zhang 2020]

**Refined Changes**: 
- **Combined Elements**: Integrated metabolomics analysis to understand the metabolic impact of TP53 on the gut microbiome.
- **New Citations**: Added [Zhang 2020] for recent findings on gut microbiome and cancer.
