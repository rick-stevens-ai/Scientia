## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Exploring the Role of TP53 in Regulating Autophagy in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates autophagy to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: Autophagy is a cellular process that can contribute to cancer development and progression [Alvarez 2016]. TP53 has been shown to regulate autophagy, but the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences autophagy are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in regulating autophagy could reveal novel insights into cancer prevention and therapy.

**Approach**: Analysis of autophagy markers and flux in TP53-deficient cells, combined with metabolomics and proteomics.
