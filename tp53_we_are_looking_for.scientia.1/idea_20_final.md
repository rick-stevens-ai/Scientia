## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Exploring the Relationship Between TP53 and Ferroptosis in Cancer

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates ferroptosis to modulate cancer development and progression.

**Paragraph**: Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression [Kang 2017]. Recent studies have shown that TP53 can regulate ferroptosis, but the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences ferroptosis are not well understood. Investigating the relationship between TP53 and ferroptosis could reveal novel insights into cancer prevention and therapy.

**Approach**: Analysis of ferroptosis markers and functional assays in TP53-deficient cells.
