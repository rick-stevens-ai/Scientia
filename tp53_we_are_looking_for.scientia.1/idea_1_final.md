## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Investigating the Role of TP53 in Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression

**Key Idea**: TP53 regulates gene expression by modulating epigenetic marks on chromatin.

**Paragraph**: TP53 is a well-known tumor suppressor protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. Recent studies have shown that TP53 can also regulate gene expression by interacting with epigenetic machinery [Li 2017]. However, the exact mechanisms by which TP53 influences epigenetic marks on chromatin are not well understood. Investigating the role of TP53 in epigenetic regulation of gene expression could reveal novel insights into its tumor suppressor functions.

**Approach**: ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq analysis of TP53-bound regions in chromatin, combined with RNA-seq and epigenetic mark analysis.
