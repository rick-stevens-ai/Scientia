Plausibility: The hypothesis is plausible. Quantum computing represents a significant leap in computational power, and its integration with AI could potentially result in a dramatic enhancement in processing speed and problem-solving capabilities. This could allow AI systems to tackle problems that are currently too complex or time-consuming for classical systems. However, it's important to note that quantum computing is still in its early stages of development, and there are significant technical challenges that must be overcome before this potential can be realized.

Novelty: The concept of integrating AI and quantum computing is not entirely new. Researchers in both academia and industry are actively exploring this intersection and its potential applications. However, the potential of this integration to lead to breakthroughs in complex fields such as quantum physics and molecular biology could be considered a novel aspect, as these are areas where the full impact of quantum computing and AI is yet to be seen.
