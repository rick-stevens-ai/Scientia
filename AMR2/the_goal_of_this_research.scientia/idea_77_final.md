# Final Report: Idea 77

## Title

: NIR-Activatable Porphyrin Prodrugs Re-Sensitise Staphylococcal SCVs to Aminoglycosides

## One Sentence Summary

: 780 nm-triggered zinc-porphyrin prodrugs transiently restore electron transport in SCVs, enhancing aminoglycoside uptake in skin infections.

## Paragraph Summary

: 780 nm penetrates 6 mm tissue; liposomal localisation limits heating and phototoxicity [St Denis 2013].
