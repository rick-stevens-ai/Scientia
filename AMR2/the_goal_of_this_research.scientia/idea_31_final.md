## Title

Allosteric Inhibition of Mycobacterial F-ATP-Synthase ε-Subunit

## One Sentence Summary

Drug‐like ligands that bind a cryptic ε-subunit pocket freeze rotary coupling and de-energise M. tuberculosis while sparing mitochondria.

## Paragraph Summary

Recent cryo-EM snapshots reveal an Mtb-specific hinge between ε N- and C-terminal domains that transduces torque to the γ-shaft [Singh 2021; Guo 2021]. Molecular-dynamics simulations predict a transient, 280 Å³ hydrophobic cavity that is absent from human ATP synthase, enabling selective allosteric blockade. Coupling this mechanism with BDQ-insensitive sites minimises cross-resistance.
