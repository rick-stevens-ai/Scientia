## Title

Stapled Peptidomimetics Disrupting S. aureus IsdB–Fibrinogen Binding

## One Sentence Summary

Hydrocarbon-stapled β-hairpin peptides bind the NEAT pocket of IsdB with nanomolar affinity, blocking heme piracy and attenuating septicemia.

## Paragraph Summary

Stapling boosts serum stability ≥20-fold and promotes cell-surface retention [Skaar 2020]. Concurrent vaccination data suggest low antigenic variance, reducing resistance risk.
