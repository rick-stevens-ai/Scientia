# Final Report: Idea 58

## Title

Mesophilic pAgo Delivery via Phage-Inducible Chromosomal Island (PICI) Vectors for Dual Nucleic-Acid Cleavage in E. coli

## One Sentence Summary

A mesophilic Clostridium-derived pAgo (temperature optimum 37 Â°C) packaged in PICI particles simultaneously slices essential DNA and RNA, achieving selective bacterial kill.

## Paragraph Summary

PICIs exhibit high cargo capacity and gut-stable delivery [Cao 2019]. Mesophilic pAgo circumvents TtAgo temperature limitation.
