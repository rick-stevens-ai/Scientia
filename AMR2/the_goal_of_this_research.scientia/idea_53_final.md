# Final Report: Idea 53

## Title

Staphylococcus-Selective ClpP Hyper-Activators with Mitochondrial-Exclusion Tags

## One Sentence Summary

ADEPs bearing bulky anionic moieties fail to cross mitochondrial membranes yet hyperactivate staphylococcal ClpP, triggering uncontrolled proteolysis.

## Paragraph Summary

Anionic tags reduce human ClpP engagement while maintaining bacterial uptake via SaeRS-induced cationic peptide transporters [Carney 2021].
