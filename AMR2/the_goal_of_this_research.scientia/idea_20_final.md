# Final Report: Idea 20

## Title

Mycobacterial Ribosome Rescue Factor (ArfB) Inhibitors to Block Persister Awakening

## One Sentence Summary

Small molecules preventing ArfB binding to stalled ribosomes will prolong translational arrest, killing dormant Mtb persisters.

## Paragraph Summary

ArfB rescues non-stop ribosomes; its absence is lethal under stress [Gopal 2019]. No drugs yet exploit this vulnerability.
