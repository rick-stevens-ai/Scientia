# Final Report: Idea 74

## Title

: Esterase-Unmasked Allenamide Pro-Inhibitors of Mtb Cholesterol Oxidase Cyp125

## One Sentence Summary

: Macrophage esterases unmask cholesterol-mimetic allenamides that covalently inactivate Cyp125, shutting cholesterol catabolism with minimal human CYP cross-reactivity.

## Paragraph Summary

: Masking cuts off-target human CYP binding by >50× in microsomes, while esterase activity in phagosomes provides rapid release (t₁/₂ ≈ 15 min) [Joseph 2021].
