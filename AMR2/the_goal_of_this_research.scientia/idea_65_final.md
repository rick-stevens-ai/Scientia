# Final Report: Idea 65

## Title

: Target-Validated c-di-AMP Exporter (CdaE) Inhibitors to Collapse S. aureus Ion Homeostasis

## One Sentence Summary

: Identified MFS exporter CdaE is inhibited with nanomolar sulfonyl-triazoles, driving toxic c-di-AMP build-up and resensitising bacteria to β-lactams.

## Paragraph Summary

: CRISPRi essentiality mapping and intracellular split-luciferase biosensors confirm CdaE as the dominant exporter [Huynh 2022; Corrigan 2020].  Excess messenger perturbs K⁺ uptake and DNA repair [Whiteley 2019].
