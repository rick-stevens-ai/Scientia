# Final Report: Idea 93

## Title



## One Sentence Summary



## Paragraph Summary

Time-resolved cryo-EM and HDX-MS have revealed a 280 Å³ hydrophobic cavity that opens only during torque transmission [Guo 2021; Singh 2021].  MD/Markov-state modelling now confirms a ≥200 µs residence time—long enough for drug binding.  Freezing this hinge is orthogonal to bedaquiline’s c-ring blockade, offering a partner drug active against BDQ-resistant strains.
