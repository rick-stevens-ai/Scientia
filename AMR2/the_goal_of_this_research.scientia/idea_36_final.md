# Final Report: Idea 36

## Title

Host-Mimic Scaffold Inhibitors of Mycobacterial Pup Ligase PafA

## One Sentence Summary

Macrocyclic peptidomimetics emulating E3-ubiquitin α-helices competitively block Pupylation, crippling Mtb proteostasis under nitrosative stress.

## Paragraph Summary

MD-guided macrocyclisation condenses the 700 Å² protein–protein interface into a drug-like scaffold with improved penetration across the Mtb cell envelope [Rao 2020]. Hydrophobic patch optimisation minimises human E3 off-target binding.
