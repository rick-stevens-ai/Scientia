## Title

Cell-Penetrating Stapled Helices Targeting E. coli β-Clamp–Polymerase Interface

## One Sentence Summary

Arginine-rich, hydrocarbon-stapled α-helices mimic Pol III δ peptides, blocking β-clamp interactions and halting replication.

## Paragraph Summary

Incorporating bicyclic cell-penetrating tags circumvents efflux and proteolysis [Walensky 2014]. Resistance is suppressed through multivalent clamp binding.
