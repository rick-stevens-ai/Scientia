# Final Report: Idea 85

## Title

: pH-Responsive Histidine-Rich Nanofibers Transiently Permeabilise the Mtb Envelope

## One Sentence Summary

: At phagosomal pH 6.0, histidine-rich amphiphilic nanofibers insert into mycolic layers, enhancing antibiotic influx yet disassemble at neutral pH, sparing host cells.

## Paragraph Summary

: Tryptophan substitutions raise serum stability (t₁/₂ > 4 h) without elevating macrophage toxicity [Huang 2021].
