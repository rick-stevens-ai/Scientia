# Final Report: Idea 64

## Title

: Acr-Refractory dCas13a T7 Phages for Collateral RNA Storms in E. coli

## One Sentence Summary

: T7 phages encoding engineered dCas13a plus tri-guide arrays ablate essential RNAs; rational surface-capsid mutation improves gut-mucus penetration.

## Paragraph Summary

: An Acr-resistant K167R dCas13a retains collateral RNase activity in the presence of common anti-CRISPR proteins [Marino 2022].  Short (20 min) T7 lytic cycle limits horizontal guide-RNA transfer.
