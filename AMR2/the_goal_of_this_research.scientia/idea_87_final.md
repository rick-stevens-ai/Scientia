# Final Report: Idea 87

## Title

: ROS-Cleavable Ferrichrome–Oxazolidinone Conjugates Exploit ESX-3 Uptake in Mtb

## One Sentence Summary

: Boronic-ester self-immolative linkers respond to Mtb phagosomal ROS, releasing oxazolidinone after ESX-3-mediated import.

## Paragraph Summary

: ESX-3 expression peaks in iron-limited macrophages; ROS-cleavage t₁/₂ ≈ 30 min ensures release before efflux [Arnold 2021].
