# Final Report: Idea 25

## Title

Transient Permeabilization of Mycobacterial Outer Envelope Using Self-Assembling Peptide Nanofibers

## One Sentence Summary

Amphiphilic peptide nanofibers will insert into mycolic acid layers, granting entry to otherwise impermeant antibiotics.

## Paragraph Summary

The mycobacterial envelope is a formidable barrier; transient permeabilization avoids full lysis and immune activation [Dartois 2014].
