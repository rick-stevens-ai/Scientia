# Final Report: Idea 4

## Title

CRISPRi-Phage Hybrid Targeting E. coli Essential RNAs

## One Sentence Summary

Engineered lytic phages delivering dCas13a plus guide RNAs against multiple essential transcripts will achieve ultra-specific E. coli killing.

## Paragraph Summary

Cas13a cleaves target RNA nonspecifically after activation, amplifying lethality [Abudayyeh 2017]. Packaging CRISPRi into T7 phage genomes exploits efficient infection while limiting horizontal gene transfer.
