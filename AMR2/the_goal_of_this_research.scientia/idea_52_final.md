# Final Report: Idea 52

## Title

Peptide-Guided Arsenoxide (III) Covalent Inhibitors of H. influenzae HepI with Rapid Renal Clearance

## One Sentence Summary

Short, D-peptide transport vectors deliver low-dose arsenoxides that irreversibly block HepI, with renal-clearable PEG preventing host accumulation.

## Paragraph Summary

Arsenoxide is 100-fold more potent against HepI Cys165 than mammalian homologues [King 2019]. PEG reduces systemic retention, lowering toxicity.
