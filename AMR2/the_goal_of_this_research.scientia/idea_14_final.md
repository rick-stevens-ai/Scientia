# Final Report: Idea 14

## Title

Interrupting Mycobacterial Cholesterol Catabolism with Suicide Allenamides

## One Sentence Summary

Allenamide adducts targeting enzyme Cyp125 will irreversibly block the first oxidative step in cholesterol breakdown, starving Mtb in host macrophages.

## Paragraph Summary

Cholesterol is indispensable carbon source for intracellular Mtb [Yang 2019]. Cyp125’s active cysteine can undergo Michael addition with allenamide electrophiles, an unexplored tactic.
