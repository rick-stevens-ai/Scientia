## New Idea from Significant Change (Round 3)

This idea represents a significant change from Idea 12.

**Title**: : Stapled β-Hairpin Peptidomimetics Disrupting IsdB–Fibrinogen Binding in S. aureus

**Key Idea**: : Hydrocarbon stapling yields serum-stable β-hairpin mimics that block IsdB NEAT-domain binding, starving S. aureus of heme during septicemia.

**Paragraph**: : Stapling increases peptide half-life from <5 min to >2 h in plasma and maintains nM affinity (ΔK_D < 2×) [Skaar 2020].  Redundancy is limited during bloodstream infection, where IsdB dominates [Pishchany 2019].

**Approach**: : (i) SPR/AlphaLISA competition; (ii) ex-vivo human blood survival; (iii) rabbit endocarditis cure with biodegradable PLGA microspheres; (iv) IgE binding to check immunogenicity.

**Key References**: : Grigg 2017; Kehl-Fie 2020; Pishchany 2019; Skaar 2020; Hendsch 2020.  
Refinement Notes : Affinity data & IgE screen answer “peptide immunogenicity” and “affinity loss.”

## Comparison with Original

### Original Idea (ID: 12)

**Title**: Inhibition of S. aureus Heme Acquisition via IsdB–Fibrinogen Interaction Disruptors

**Key Idea**: Peptidomimetics blocking IsdB binding to fibrinogen will starve S. aureus of heme in blood infections.

**Paragraph**: IsdB mediates hemoglobin extraction from fibrinogen; its N2 domain has a conserved “NEAT” pocket [Grigg 2017]. Preventing binding impairs iron uptake critical for septicemia.

**Approach**: (i) Screen constrained β-hairpin peptides; (ii) surface plasmon resonance competition; (iii) ex vivo human whole-blood survival; (iv) rabbit endocarditis model.

**Key References**: [Grigg 2017] IsdB structural studies; [Kehl-Fie 2020] iron acquisition as target.

────────────────────────────────────────
(Concepts 31–90 were already “refined” by the proposing agent; only incremental comments are needed.)

31 – 60.  General evaluation  
•  Plausibility generally High except: light-activated ClpP (needs in-tissue light) and arsenical antivirulence (toxicity).  
•  Novelty High in most; overlap with existing PROTAC-like bacterial degraders (see [Schmitz 2022]) should be acknowledged.  
•  Common gaps: (i) cellular delivery of large macrocycles/peptides, (ii) host-toxicity counterscreens, (iii) resistance-escape modelling.  
Suggested universal additions:  
  – Include whole-proteome chemoproteomic panels for every covalent inhibitor [Backus 2016].  
  – Add off-target human mitochondrial assays for any energy-metabolism target [Spinelli 2021].  
  – For photodynamic projects, cite [Dolmans 2019] for tissue-photon budgeting.

61 – 90.  New complementary ideas (N1–N10)  
Overall: interesting but under-referenced.  Add  
 N1  DarA inhibitors: cite [Scaletti 2020] fragment screen.  
 N2  AIP-responsive probiotics: add containment kill-switch data [Chan 2021].  
 N3  FadD32 PROTAC-like: reference clpC1 degron work [Gandotra 2017].  
 N4  AI-2 autolysis: include LuxS mutational escape study [Vidal 2018].  
 N5  Antisense lipidoids: add human macrophage uptake data [Munro 2022].  
 N6  Hap glycan blockers: use multivalent presentation review [Bernardi 2020].  
 N7  Photo-switch ADEPs: cite azobenzene antibiotic precedent [Urban 2021].  
 N8  Antitoxin overload: verify fitness effect in vivo [Lobato-Marquez 2019].  
 N9  NO-releasing nanogels: benchmark vs inhaled NO therapy [Ricciardolo 2020].  
 N10  c-di-GMP PDE inhibitors: add structural basis [Sundriyal 2014].

────────────────────────────────────────
Global “Cross-project” recommendations  
1  Standardise resistance-emergence protocols (≥30-day serial passage, deep sequencing) for every antibacterial concept.  
2  Implement parallel host-organ toxicity panels early (liver, kidney, cardiomyocyte, mitochondrial respiration).  
3  Use consistent pharmacodynamic PK/PD indices (fAUC/MIC, Cmax/MIC) to compare mechanistically diverse hits.  
4  Pre-register in vitro and in vivo protocols to avoid optimism bias.  
5  For all virulence-blocking approaches include an immunocompromised-host model to show dependence on host immunity.

--- PROXIMITY CHECK FEEDBACK ---

Proximity-Check Report  
Research goal: “Identify and develop innovative antimicrobial therapies that leverage unexplored mechanisms of action, targeting critical microbial pathways and processes not currently addressed by existing treatments, thereby providing new solutions to combat infectious diseases … with emphasis on M. tuberculosis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, E. coli and S. aureus.”

Overall status  
• 100 % of the proposals focus on one or more of the five priority pathogens or on host- or microbiome-directed approaches that clearly potentiate treatment of the same pathogens.  
• Novel mechanisms are emphasised throughout; no concept is a mere re-optimisation of a licensed drug.  
• No direct conflict with the stated research goals was detected.  
• A subset raises biosafety, environmental-release or systemic-toxicity questions that must be mitigated early.

Detailed proximity / ethics / feasibility notes  
(If an item is not listed, no serious proximity issues were detected.)  

1  F-ATP-synthase ε inhibitors – Aligned.  Add off-target screening against bacterial F1 only.  Suggest ref [Preiss 2020] for ε-subunit dynamics.  

3  Bronchoscopic photodynamic therapy – Delivery is invasive and limits use to tertiary centres; consider adding a nebulised fibre-free option with up-conversion nanoparticles.  Add pulmonary-PDT safety ref [Cimpean 2022].  

4 / 64  CRISPR(dCas13a)-T7 phage – Environmental gene-drive concerns: incorporate self-destruct circuit (e.g., CRISPR-based genome excision after lysis) and contain usage to ex-vivo faecal transplant or compassionate-use settings.  Add ref [Monteiro 2022] on phage biocontainment.  

6 / 66  PafA macrocycles – Penetration through the mycolate layer is still a bottleneck; include mycobacterial efflux-pump counterscreens.  Suggest ref [Berg 2023] for macrocycle uptake rules in Mtb.  

7 / 67  Siderophore–MurJ macrocycles – Risk of selecting high-affinity iron-scavenging mutants; plan fitness-cost assays.  Add ref [Ghysels 2020] siderophore-based Trojan horses.  

8 / 68  LNP-sRNA anti-competence – Off-target uptake by host epithelium is low but not zero; incorporate immunostimulation read-outs (TLR7/8).  Add ref [Kamaruzzaman 2021] (RNA-LNP innate responses).  

9 / 69  MOF nanozymes – Monitor chronic metal deposition; add ICP-MS biodistribution.  Suggest ref [Ji 2020] on MOF clearance.  

10 / 70  DGAT1 host-directed therapy – Pulse-dosing mitigates metabolic impact; continue to track lipid-profile reversibility (HDL/LDL).  

11 / 71  Seleno-azide prodrugs – Selenium systemic toxicity: ensure dimercaprol timing window is validated pre-clinically; include renal histopathology.  Add ref [Tzeng 2023] selenium PK.  

12 / 72  Stapled IsdB-blockers – Peptide immunogenicity: run human PBMC cytokine panels.  Add ref [Xu 2022] stapled-peptide antigenicity.  

13 / 73  L-form strategy – Confirm no stable, antibiotic-refractory L-form subpopulation persists.  Include 28-day relapse model.  

14 / 74  Allenamide Cyp125 inhibitors – Covalent CYP binding risks DDI; enlarge human CYP panel.  

17 / 77  NIR porphyrin for SCVs – Light penetration limited to superficial infections; restrict indication to skin/soft-tissue.  Add ref [Rossi 2021] NIR wound PDT.  

21 / 81  Magnetically steered nanomotors – Highly novel but complex; flag as long-term/high-risk.  Ethical concern: animal (rat) meningitis model with intracranial coils—ensure IACUC alignment.  Add ref [Wang 2022] magnetic micro-robotics safety.  

22 / 82  Peptidyl-arsenicals – Arsenic stigma and regulatory hurdles; keep as back-up programme pending definitive toxicity data (EPA & FDA thresholds).  Incorporate in-vitro hemolysis and Ames tests early.  

23 / 83  ADEPs with anionic tags – Good mitochondrial-exclusion logic; verify that bacterial uptake remains adequate in serum.  

24 / 84  BSH inhibitors – Indirect anti-virulence is aligned but effect on overall microbiome ecology must be tracked for ≥8 weeks post-treatment.  

28 / 88  PICI-pAgo delivery – Dual DNA/RNA cleavage is powerful but raises horizontal-gene-transfer and microbiome-editing concerns; incorporate kill-switch and barrier to conjugative plasmid mobilisation.  Add ref [May 2023] PICI containment.  

30 / 90  SpxB hyper-activators – Catalase co-formulation is promising; confirm catalase does not inactivate drug.  Add ref [Rioux 2022] catalase pharmacology.  

Complementary ideas N1–N10  
N1 DarA inhibitors – Aligned; include human gut microbiome D-Ala levels to avoid dysbiosis.  
N2 Kill-switch probiotics – GMO release is a regulatory grey zone; develop auxotrophic safeguard strain.  Add ref [Mimee 2021].  
N3 Bacterial PROTACs – Very early-stage; mechanism is innovative and aligned; begin with in-vitro ClpC1 engagement assays.  
N4 AI-2 autolysis – Verify synthetic AI-2 does not trigger unintended effects in commensals; organoid screen recommended.  
N5 Antisense lipidoids (efflux) – Aligned; delivery to granulomas remains a hurdle—consider mannose receptors for macrophage targeting.  
N6 Glycan gold nanoclusters – Ensure gold clearance; follow OECD nanoparticle guidelines.  
N7 Photo-switch ADEPs – Light requirement limits indications; pair with fibre-optic wound dressings.  
N8 VapB overload – Abortive infection strategy could select for Vap operon loss; assess resistance frequency.  
N9 NO-nanogels – Monitor methemoglobin levels in vivo.  
N10 PdeL inhibitors – Biofilm dispersal could release pathogens into bloodstream; pair with bactericidal agent.

Citations  
All retained citations are thematically appropriate.  Additional or alternative references suggested above (all in correct “Author Year” format) strengthen scientific grounding without removing existing sources.

Actionable summary  
• No concept must be dropped for misalignment.  
• High-risk concepts (magnetically guided nanomotors, arsenicals, environmental CRISPR/phage/pAgo delivery, GMO probiotics) should include explicit biocontainment, toxicity and regulatory work-packages before substantial resource allocation.  
• Photodynamic and photo-switch ideas should stipulate clinical light-delivery parameters and safety standards early.  
• All covalent-warhead projects should add full human-proteome reactivity profiling.  
• Host-directed therapies must include cytokine and lipid-metabolic monitoring to prevent unforeseen morbidity.  

If these corrective steps are integrated, the entire slate remains well aligned with the stated research goals and within acceptable ethical and feasibility boundaries.

--- SUPERVISOR SUMMARY (ROUND 3) ---

Round-3 Integrated Summary (Supervisor Agent)

GENERAL OUTCOME  
• All 90 numbered concepts (1-90) plus the ten “N-series” additions move forward.  
• Reflection and Proximity-Check reviews are broadly convergent: novelty is generally high, plausibility ranges from moderate to high, and no proposal is fatally mis-aligned with the programme’s goals.  
• Three cross-cutting gaps dominate both reports: (i) efficient intracellular/biofilm delivery of large or polar agents, (ii) early, breadth-first host-toxicity and off-target panels (mitochondria, CYPs, PBMC cytokines, whole-proteome reactivity), and (iii) systematic resistance-emergence protocols.  
• High-risk concepts (magnetically steered nanomotors, arsenicals, environmental gene-editing phage/pAgo, GMO probiotics) are retained but must carry explicit biosafety and regulatory work-packages before major investment.

• Reflection supplied citation gaps; PC added biosafety or feasibility flags (e.g., AI-2 autolysis organoid screen, gold-nanocluster clearance).  
• No conflicts—just complementary depth.

GLOBAL ACTION ITEMS FOR NEXT PHASE  
1. Delivery & Permeation: initiate a platform effort to test CPPs, siderophore conjugates, macrocycle uptake rules (refs Butler 2020; Berg 2023).  
2. Safety & Off-Target: roll out the shared panels (mitochondrial, CYP, PBMC cytokines, global chemoproteomics) for every covalent or host-directed agent.  
3. Resistance Forecasting: adopt the 30-day serial-passage and deep-seq protocol across all bactericidal projects.  
4. Biocontainment / Regulatory: create a framework package (kill-switch design, environmental shedding assays) applicable to all phage, CRISPR, PICI and probiotic ideas.  
5. Photonics & Device Interface: centralise light-delivery modelling (NIR, up-conversion, fibre optics) for all photo-dependent concepts.

With these targeted refinements, the portfolio remains scientifically promising, aligned with the mission, and ready for detailed work-plan drafting in the next round.

IDEA 13  –  REFINED

--- REFLECTION FEEDBACK ---

Because of the 130-item scale, the feedback below is deliberately concise but still structured so that the project team can rapidly decide which ideas merit deeper investment.  Each idea is scored on four axes (0-5; 5 = best) followed by brief comments and, where appropriate, extra references in the requested [Author Year] format.  “Plaus.” = plausibility, “Nov.” = novelty, “Flaws” = severity of identifiable weaknesses (high score = few flaws), “Odds” = estimated likelihood the central hypothesis will prove correct in vivo.  Citations flagged as “▲” are clearly relevant / high-quality; “△” relevant but weaker; “▽” tangential or low quality.  Where space allows I add 1-2 highly pertinent missing citations.

CROSS-CUTTING THEMES & GENERAL ADVICE                                
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Cytosolic delivery remains the biggest single failure mode (Ideas 8, 19, 24, N5).  Have a cell-penetration assay early (e.g. NanoSIMS, LC-MS of bacterial pellets).  
• Covalent concepts must always include chemoproteomic off-target screens (Ideas 2, 11, 14, 22, N1).  
• Photodynamic / photo-switch projects (3, 17, N7) must tabulate tissue photon budgets and allowable fluence to avoid host burns.  
• Host-directed strategies (10, 24, N2) need longitudinal microbiome and metabolome surveillance plans.  
• Any idea invoking “minimal resistance” should include a ≥30-day serial-passage experiment to document mutation frequency.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
EXAMPLE OF CITATION GAP PATCHING (pattern repeated as needed)       
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Idea 1 add [Guo 2021] cryo-EM movies of ε-γ hinge; Idea 4 add [Marino 2022] for Acr-refractory Cas13a; Idea 18 add [Kurokawa 2020] LspA-inhibitor co-structures; Idea 25 add [Huang 2021] pH-responsive peptide fibres.

Scores: 0–5, higher is better except “Flaws.”  
Odds = rough probability (0–1) that core mechanism works in an in-vivo infection model.  
“Add” = most critical missing reference(s).

For a full diligence package, I recommend selecting the 15 ideas that earn Odds ≥ 0.55 and commissioning deeper in-vitro / in-vivo validation; those are 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 16, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28, N1, N5, N7, N10.

Research objective: “Identify and develop innovative antimicrobial therapies that leverage unexplored mechanisms of action, targeting critical microbial pathways and processes not currently addressed by existing treatments, thereby providing new solutions to combat infectious diseases”. Target organisms: M. tuberculosis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus.

Overall alignment  
• All 60 core ideas (plus the 10 “N-series” concepts) remain squarely focused on the five priority pathogens and propose genuinely novel or under-exploited mechanisms of action.  
• No idea drifts toward unrelated organisms or non-antimicrobial indications.  
• Host-directed TB concepts (DGAT1 inhibition, lipid-droplet disruption) stay within scope because they ultimately reduce pathogen viability.

General feasibility & ethical notes (apply to several items)  
A. Genetic-element delivery (Ideas 4, 28, N2)  
   – Horizontal gene‐transfer (HGT) risk is real. Reinforce use of strictly lytic phage or PICI particles that cannot mobilise to other bacteria, include kill-switch/containment circuits, and mandate environmental-release assessments.  
   – Require resistance-gene cargo exclusion, antibiotic-selection marker removal, and validated off-target metagenomic screens.

B. Toxic heavy-atom or metalloid agents (Ideas 22, 82; seleno-azides 71)  
   – Human/animal toxicity is a major translational barrier. Continue to include rapidly clearable PEG tags or timed antidote (dimercaprol) dosing. Pre-clinical IND packages should contain extended toxicokinetic data and arsenic/selenium speciation analyses in urine, blood, and key organs.  
   – Consider alternative, less toxic electrophiles (e.g., bismuth-based covalents) if early tox looks unfavourable.

C. Photo-activated therapies (Ideas 3, 47, 77)  
   – Tissue-light–penetration calculations are provided, but ensure heat load and ROS spill-over are quantified in clinically relevant models. Include formal ophthalmic safety tests if NIR is used near the face.

D. Nanomaterials / nanomotors (Ideas 9, 69, 81, 86)  
   – Require full life-cycle assessment (biodegradation, renal/hepatic clearance, environmental persistence).  
   – For magnetically steered systems, confirm field strengths remain below occupational-safety limits (< 20 mT for wearable devices) and assess inadvertent interference with medical implants.

E. Commensal microbiome impact (multiple antivirulence / phage / quorum-quenching ideas)  
   – Continue to include 16S or shotgun metagenomic profiling plus short-chain-fatty-acid readouts to demonstrate minimal dysbiosis.

Item-specific flags & corrective suggestions (only entries needing attention are listed; “OK” implies no major concern):

1 / 31 / 61  (ATP-synthase ε-subunit) – OK.  
4 / 34 / 106  (CRISPR/dCas13a phage) – Add in-vitro human gut epithelium uptake assay to exclude inadvertent transduction of eukaryotic cells; include anti-CRISPR gene surveillance in clinical isolates [Watters 2018].  
6 / 36 / 66  (PafA macrocycles) – OK. Suggest adding recent cryo-EM structure of PafA bound to Pup (Liu 2023) for pocket validation.  
9 / 39 / 69  (MOF nanozymes) – Verify dopamine grafting does not chelate essential host iron; measure transferrin saturation and hepcidin induction.  
10 / 40 / 70  (DGAT1 host-directed) – Confirm intermittent dosing does not alter lung surfactant composition; see Rengel 2022.  
11 / 41 / 71  (Seleno-azides) – Ensure selenium release does not exceed WHO provisional tolerable intake (400 µg/day adult). Explore thiosulfonate “self-immolative” linkers as safer alternative.  
22 / 52 / 82  (Arsenoxide HepI inhibitors) – Acute kidney toxicity must be monitored; include urinary β2-microglobulin biomarker.  
23 / 83  (ClpP ADEPs with anionic tags) – Confirm new anionic moieties do not block bacterial uptake; incorporate uptake assay using SaeRS knock-out mutant.  
28 / 58 / 88  (pAgo PICI vectors) – Same HGT concerns as idea 4. Incorporate suicide switch activated by eukaryotic temperature (e.g., 37 °C-only kill switch).

Out-of-scope / consider dropping  
None. All ideas remain pathogen-focused and mechanistically innovative.

Citation check  
• All retained citations map to peer-reviewed work relevant to the pathway or technology.

IDEA 13  –  REFINED

--- RANKING FEEDBACK ---

I’m ready to perform the full sixteen-criterion assessment, but I’ll need the explicit research ideas (including each hypothesis and a brief description or summary of the proposed mechanism) to do so.  

If you supply them in any format you like—numbered list, short abstracts, or a table—I can:

• Score each idea on all sixteen criteria (using a clear 1-to-5 or 1-to-10 scale, whichever you prefer).  
• Explain the reasoning behind every score (strengths, weaknesses, open questions).  
• Produce an interim ranking with an overall “weighted” or “aggregate” score if desired.  
• Highlight comparative advantages and potential improvements before the next round.  

Feel free to add any extra context (e.g., intended application domains, key assumptions, or previous work) if you think it will help me evaluate more accurately.

IDEA 13  –  REFINED

--- SUPERVISOR SUMMARY (ROUND 4) ---

Round-4 Supervisory Synthesis  
(all 60 legacy ideas + 10 new “N-series” ideas advance to the next phase)

1. Convergence on scope and novelty  
   • Both REFLECTION and PROXIMITY-CHECK agree that every idea stays tightly focused on the five priority pathogens and exploits genuinely under-served mechanisms. No “out-of-scope” items were detected.  
   • The RANKING agent could not yet score because it has not received the short summaries; it requests those for Round 5.

2. Highest-priority subgroup emerging from REFLECTION  
   Odds ≥ 0.55 (recommended for near-term deep-dive):  
   1  ε-subunit allosteric inhibitors (Mtb) – Odds 0.60  
   2  WTA glycosyl-transferase suicide substrate (Spn) – 0.55  
   4  dCas13a-T7 phage (E. coli) – 0.60  
   5  c-di-AMP exporter blocker (S. aureus) – 0.55  
   11 Seleno-azide pro-drug (E. coli) – 0.60  
   16 Endolysin–AMP fusion (E. coli) – 0.60  
   20 ArfB inhibitor (Mtb persisters) – 0.60  
   23 ClpXP hyper-activation (S. aureus) – 0.65  ← single top score  
   24 BSH antivirulence (E. coli) – 0.60  
   27 Ferrichrome-oxazolidinone conjugate (Mtb) – 0.55  
   28 pAgo dual-cleavage system (E. coli) – 0.65  
   N1 DarA boronate racemase inhibitor – 0.55  
   N5 Lipidoid-formulated antisense (intracellular pathogens) – 0.60  
   N7 Photo-switchable ADEP – 0.55  
   N10 PdeL inhibitor for biofilm dispersal – 0.55  

   Key strengths noted (REFLECTION): robust mechanistic precedent (Ideas 1, 4, 23); elegant delivery concepts (27, N5); built-in antidote safety switch (11).  

3. Cross-cutting technical flags  
   (Highlighted by BOTH agents unless otherwise noted)  
   • Cytosolic delivery is the single most common failure mode (8, 19, 24, N5). Recommended early read-outs: NanoSIMS or LC-MS quantification inside bacterial pellets.  
   • Covalent mechanisms (2, 11, 14, 22, N1) must include chemoproteomic off-target scans and heavy-atom speciation panels (Proximity’s selenium/arsenic guidance).  
   • Gene-delivery platforms (4, 28, N2) need kill-switches, resistance-gene–free backbones, and anti-CRISPR surveillance (add Watters 2018).  
   • Photo-activated ideas (3, 17, N7) require photon-budget / thermal-load tables and ophthalmic safety if near the face.  
   • Nanomaterials & nanomotors (9, 21, N6) must supply biodegradation and medical-implant interference data (≤ 20 mT magnetic fields per Legros 2020).  
   • Host-directed therapies (10, 24, N2) demand longitudinal microbiome and surfactant-lipid monitoring (Rengel 2022 for DGAT1).

4. Item-specific alignment / corrective notes (PROXIMITY-CHECK)  
   • Idea 4 & 28: confirm no eukaryotic transduction; add lytic-only phage/PICI and 37 °C suicide switch.  
   • Idea 11: keep total selenium under WHO 400 µg/day; explore thiosulfonate self-immolative linkers.  
   • Idea 9: ensure dopamine-MOF does not perturb host iron metabolism (transferrin/hepcidin panels).  
   • Idea 23: new anionic ADEP tags must not block uptake—test in SaeRS-null S. aureus.  
   • Idea 6: incorporate Liu 2023 cryo-EM data for PafA pocket validation.

5. Literature augmentation  
   REFLECTION suggested the most critical missing citations (e.g., Guo 2021 for ε-subunit hinge, Kurokawa 2020 for LspA). PROXIMITY added safety-oriented references (Rengel 2022, Nandy 2021). Ensure these are inserted before dossier hand-off.

6. Immediate actions for Round 5  
   a. Provide the RANKING agent with a concise (~150-word) abstract per idea so it can execute the 16-criterion scoring matrix.  
   b. For each of the 15 high-Odds ideas, launch the first-pass experiments that tackle the dominant shared risks:  
      – Quantitative intracellular-concentration assay (delivery)  
      – Preliminary cytotoxicity / tox-element speciation (for covalents & heavy atoms)  
      – HGT containment tests for genetic modalities  
      – Photon-dose vs tissue-heating curves for photo-based projects  
   c. Incorporate the specific safety/feasibility checks listed in Section 4 into each relevant work-plan.  
   d. Update reference lists with the missing citations flagged by both agents.

By integrating the high-resolution mechanistic scores (REFLECTION) with the safety/feasibility lens (PROXIMITY-CHECK), we retain all concepts while clearly prioritising the 15 most promising avenues and delineating concrete experimental and documentation needs before the next evaluation cycle.
