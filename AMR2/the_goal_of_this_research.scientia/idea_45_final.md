# Final Report: Idea 45

## Title

Cell-Penetrant FMN-Riboswitch Ligands with Salvage-Pathway Bypass Inhibitors

## One Sentence Summary

Ribityl-fluorinated FMN analogues bind pneumococcal riboswitches and co-deliver riboflavin kinase inhibitors, shutting down vitamin B₂ biosynthesis and salvage simultaneously.

## Paragraph Summary

Dual action precludes metabolic bypass, and cationic-lipid conjugation enhances uptake [Newman 2022].
