## Title

: Cell-Penetrant Fluorophosphonate-UDP Warheads Against Pneumococcal WTA Glycosyl-Transferases

## One Sentence Summary

: Cyclic-boronate–modified fluorophosphonate-UDP analogues traverse the Gram-positive envelope and covalently acylate catalytic Lys/His residues, collapsing wall-teichoic-acid assembly.

## Paragraph Summary

: Surface-facing WTA GTs tolerate polar head-groups but not boronate flanking rings, giving an exploitable selectivity window [Soldo 2021].  Covalent capture prevents efflux-mediated escape and slows resistance.

## Key Ideas and Implementation

This section provides a detailed explanation of the key ideas and how they could be implemented or tested.

### Implementation and Testing Approach

: (i) Prodrug-mask the boronate to aid uptake, with intracellular β-lactamase-cleavable linkers; (ii) LC-MS/MS confirmation of Lys-FP adducts; (iii) CRISPRi titration to verify on-target lethality; (iv) zebrafish sepsis and human whole-blood activity; (v) chemoproteomic off-target screen against 12 human UDP-transferases.
