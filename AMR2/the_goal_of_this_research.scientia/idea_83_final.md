# Final Report: Idea 83

## Title

: Anionic-Tagged ADEPs Hyper-Activate Staphylococcal ClpP While Excluding Mitochondria

## One Sentence Summary

: Sulfonate-tagged ADEPs fail to cross mitochondrial membranes but enter S. aureus via SaeRS-upregulated cationic transporters, triggering lethal proteolysis.

## Paragraph Summary

: ClpP mutants carry high fitness cost in virulence settings [Gersch 2015]; sulfonate reduces mammalian ClpP IC₅₀ by 20-fold.
