# Final Report: Idea 28

## Title

Dual RNA/Protein Degradation via Programmable Prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo) Systems in E. coli

## One Sentence Summary

Delivering pAgo with guide DNA can simultaneously nick chromosomal DNA and degrade mRNA, ensuring lethality with minimal resistance.

## Paragraph Summary

pAgos act independently of PAM requirements and can be reprogrammed [Swarts 2017]; coupling DNA and RNA attack reduces escape mutants.
