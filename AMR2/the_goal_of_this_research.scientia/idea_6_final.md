# Final Report: Idea 6

## Title

Host-Mimicking Allosteres of Mtb Pupylation Ligase (PafA)

## One Sentence Summary

Small molecules emulating human ubiquitin E3 motifs will jam the prokaryotic Pup ligase PafA, blocking mycobacterial proteasomal degradation.

## Paragraph Summary

Pupylation is unique to actinobacteria and critical under nitrosative stress [Darwin 2020]. Structural mimicry can competitively inhibit substrate recognition without human cross-reactivity.
