# Final Report: Idea 60

## Title

Hyperactivation of Pneumococcal SpxB via Allosteric Agonists with Host-Catalase Co-Therapy

## One Sentence Summary

Small-molecule agonists boost SpxB Vmax, generating lethal H₂O₂ bursts, while topical catalase protects host epithelium.

## Paragraph Summary

Local catalase gel neutralises extracellular ROS, confining damage to intracellular bacteria [Lisher 2017].
