## Title

: Stapled β-Hairpin Peptidomimetics Disrupting IsdB–Fibrinogen Binding in S. aureus

## One Sentence Summary

: Hydrocarbon stapling yields serum-stable β-hairpin mimics that block IsdB NEAT-domain binding, starving S. aureus of heme during septicemia.

## Paragraph Summary

: Stapling increases peptide half-life from <5 min to >2 h in plasma and maintains nM affinity (ΔK_D < 2×) [Skaar 2020].  Redundancy is limited during bloodstream infection, where IsdB dominates [Pishchany 2019].
