## Title

SUMO-RPA32 Sequesters Hippo Kinase MST1 at Stalled Forks to Enable Damage-Tolerance Cycling

## One Sentence Summary

Radiation-specific SUMO2 conjugation on RPA32 binds the SIM of MST1, trapping the kinase at replication forks, suppressing LATS1 and freeing YAP to drive proliferation.

## Paragraph Summary

SUMO-proteomics shows RPA32-K164/K185 conjugation peaks 20 min post-IR. SIM-mutant MST1 fails to co-localise with RPA; LATS1-T1079 phosphorylation drops 60 % in WT but not SIM-mutant cells, elevating TEAD-luciferase.
