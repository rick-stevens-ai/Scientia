## Title

Radiation-Enhanced R-Loop Clustering Creates FEN1-Dependent Fragile Sites

## One Sentence Summary

IR stabilizes RNA:DNA hybrids at replication forks; aberrant FEN1 binding to clustered R-loops generates double-cut fragments conducive to chromothripsis.

## Paragraph Summary

R-loops are co-transcriptional structures linked to genome instability. We hypothesize Î³-H2AX recruits FEN1 to R-loops instead of Okazaki flaps, cleaving both strands and forming double cuts. Clustering of such events along chromosomes predisposes to shattering and rejoining characteristic of chromothripsis seen in cancers.
