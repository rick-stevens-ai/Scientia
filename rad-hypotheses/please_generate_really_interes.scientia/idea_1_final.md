## Title

Radiation-Induced Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation of p53–YAP Complex Drives Early Oncogenic Transcription

## One Sentence Summary

Ionizing radiation triggers a previously unrecognized liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) between p53 and YAP that transiently sequesters DNA-damage checkpoints while activating pro-proliferative YAP targets.

## Paragraph Summary

LLPS of DNA-damage factors has been reported for 53BP1 and FUS, but p53 itself has not been implicated in condensate formation with mechanotransducers such as YAP. We propose that clustered γ-H2AX foci nucleate multivalent interactions between the p53 C-terminal domain and the low-complexity region of YAP, forming nuclear condensates that delay p53-mediated arrest while YAP concurrently activates genes favoring survival and proliferation. This “checkpoint masking” condensate could provide the temporal niche for survival of cells with mis-repaired genomes, initiating tumorigenesis.

## Key Ideas and Implementation

This section provides a detailed explanation of the key ideas and how they could be implemented or tested.

### Implementation and Testing Approach

(i) Use live-cell fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of GFP-p53 and mCherry-YAP after 4 Gy radiation; (ii) disrupt condensates with 1,6-hexanediol or point mutations in low-complexity regions; (iii) RNA-seq to assess YAP-target activation; (iv) clonogenic transformation assays in wild-type vs. condensate-deficient mutants.
