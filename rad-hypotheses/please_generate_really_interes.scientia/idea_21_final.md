## Title

Radiation-Induced p53-YAP Condensates Temporarily Mask Checkpoints to Favour Pro-Survival Transcription

## One Sentence Summary

Ionising radiation nucleates liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) between p53 and YAP on γ-H2AX nanodomains, transiently sequestering checkpoint factors while selectively boosting YAP-driven pro-proliferative genes.

## Paragraph Summary

Building on LLPS in DNA-damage signalling, we posit that γ-H2AX foci concentrate p53 C-terminal lysine clusters and the low-complexity region of YAP. The resultant condensates physically exclude p53 co-repressors (e.g., p300) yet retain TEAD-bound YAP, delaying arrest but amplifying survival signals. Dissolution after ~2 h restores checkpoints, providing a window in which mis-repaired genomes escape elimination.

## Key Ideas and Implementation

This section provides a detailed explanation of the key ideas and how they could be implemented or tested.

### Implementation and Testing Approach

(i) In-vitro reconstitution with purified p53 and YAP low-complexity fragments ± DNA to visualise droplets; (ii) live-cell FRAP of GFP-p53/mCherry-YAP after 4 Gy; (iii) disrupt condensates with 1,6-hexanediol, p53(K→A) or YAP(LCR-Δ) mutants; (iv) RNA-seq for YAP targets; (v) clonogenic survival and focus-formation assays in condensate-competent vs. ‑deficient cells.
