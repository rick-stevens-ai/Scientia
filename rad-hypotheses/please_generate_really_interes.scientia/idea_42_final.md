## Title

Circadian Clock Disruption Potentiates Radiation-Induced Oncogenesis via REV-ERBα Control of DNA Resection Genes

## One Sentence Summary

Acute irradiation at circadian “wrong time” down-regulates REV-ERBα, de-repressing the resection genes CtIP and EXO1, creating long ssDNA overhangs that channel breaks into error-prone SSA and elevate chromosomal deletions.

## Paragraph Summary

Mouse liver irradiated at ZT18 (night) shows 5-fold higher CtIP mRNA and SSA junctions than ZT6. REV-ERBα agonist SR9009 administered pre-IR normalises CtIP levels and halves deletion frequency. This provides a mechanistic basis for chrono-modulated cancer risk.
