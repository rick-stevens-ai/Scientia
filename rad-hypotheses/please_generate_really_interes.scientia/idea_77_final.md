## Title

DNA-Protein Crosslink Neo-Antigens Drive IL-10-Rich Germinal Centres and IgG4 Class Switch

## One Sentence Summary

DPCs released post-IR stimulate dendritic cells to expand IL-10-high Tfh-10 cells, skewing B-cells to IgG4 CSR that suppresses anti-tumour immunity.

## Paragraph Summary

DPC immunisation elevates serum IgG4 five-fold in humanised mice. Germinal-centre scRNA-seq reveals IL-10-high B and Tfh-10 clusters; IgG4 occupies FcγRIIA, reducing ADCC. Anti-IL-10 antibody reverses immune suppression.
