## Title

SENP3-Cleaved Nucleolin Fragment Stabilises KRAS-GTP After rDNA Damage

## One Sentence Summary

IR-activated SENP3 cleaves nucleolin after R615, releasing an RGG-rich fragment that binds KRAS and blocks GAPs, sustaining MAPK signalling.

## Paragraph Summary

ITC shows KD â‰ˆ 200 nM for NCL-F/KRAS. SENP3-KD or RGG-mutant NCL-F lowers pERK and colony formation by 60 %. Structural modelling predicts electrostatic RGG-switch-I contacts.
