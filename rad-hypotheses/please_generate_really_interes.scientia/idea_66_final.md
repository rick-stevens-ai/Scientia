# Final Report: Idea 66

## Title

Radiation-Inducible Micropeptidome Globally Competes for BRCA1-BRCT Binding

## One Sentence Summary

A cohort of IR-upregulated lncRNA micropeptides bearing pSer-(S/T)Q-E motifs displaces BRCA1 from resected ends, driving a shift from HR to NHEJ.

## Paragraph Summary

Ribo-seq/mass-spec reveals ≥10 micro-ORFs (30–60 aa) whose translation spikes within 60 min of IR. Fluorescence polarisation shows IC50 ≈ 2 µM for BRCT binding, matching BACH1. CRISPRi of the three highest peptides restores HR, lowering indels by ~40 %.
