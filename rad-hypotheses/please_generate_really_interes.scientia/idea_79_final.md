## Title

K63-Ubiquitinated XRCC4 Bridges TGF-β Receptor I to Drive EMT After IR

## One Sentence Summary

TRAF6-mediated K63-Ub on XRCC4 exposes an L45-like motif that binds TGF-βRI, activating SMAD2/3 and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

## Paragraph Summary

XRCC4-K210R mutant cannot bind TGF-βRI post-IR; SMAD-luciferase rises three-fold in WT. Snail/Vimentin up-regulation drives invasion; TRAF6-KO or K210R abolish metastasis in orthotopic model.
