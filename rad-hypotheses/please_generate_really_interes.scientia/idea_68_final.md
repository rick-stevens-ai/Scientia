## Title

Methylglyoxal Glycation of NBS1-FHA Shortens MRN Dwell-Time and Elevates Translocations

## One Sentence Summary

IR-driven methylglyoxal forms hydro-imidazolone adducts on NBS1-R28/R43, truncating ATM signalling windows and doubling chromosomal translocations.

## Paragraph Summary

Targeted LC-MS/MS detects R28/R43 adducts; FRAP shows MRN chromatin half-life falls from 45 s to 18 s. Hi-C reveals a two-fold rise in inter-chromosomal joins reversed by aminoguanidine.
