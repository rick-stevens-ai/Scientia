## Title

NAD+ Bankruptcy Hyper-activates Cytoplasmic SIRT2 and Drives Aneuploid Mitosis

## One Sentence Summary

PARP1-induced nuclear NAD+ depletion redistributes NAD+ to cytoplasm, boosting SIRT2, lowering H4K16ac and weakening spindle-checkpoint tension sensing.

## Paragraph Summary

NAD+ sensors show 40 % nuclear loss vs 25 % cytoplasmic gain 15 min post-IR. SIRT2 activity up 1.8-fold; NR supplementation or AGK2 normalises H4K16ac and halves aneuploidy.
