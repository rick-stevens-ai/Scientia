## Title

SENP3-Dependent Nucleolin Cleavage Generates KRAS-Stabilising Fragments After rDNA Damage

## One Sentence Summary

IR-triggered rDNA breaks activate SENP3, cleaving nucleolin to produce an RGG-rich fragment (NCL-F) that binds KRAS, impedes GAP access and sustains MAPK signalling.

## Paragraph Summary

Mass-spec mapping places the cut after R615. GST-pull-down shows NCL-F-KRAS binding with KD ~ 200 nM independent of GTP state. SENP3 knockdown or RGG-mutant NCL-F abrogates sustained ERK phosphorylation and reduces colony formation by 60 %.
