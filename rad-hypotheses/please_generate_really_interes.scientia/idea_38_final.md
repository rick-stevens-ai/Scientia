## Title

Stress-Linearised mtDNA Uses RPA-Mediated Nuclear Import to Seed NUMT Insertions at DSBs

## One Sentence Summary

IR-induced mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilisation releases linear mtDNA that binds RPA, translocates through nuclear pores via importin-β/XPOT and integrates into chromosomal DSBs by NHEJ.

## Paragraph Summary

Time-resolved live-cell imaging with PicoGreen-labelled mtDNA shows nuclear entry within 30 min post-IR. RPA-S33A mutant abolishes import, implicating RPA-mtDNA coating. Oxford Nanopore detects new NUMTs flanked by NHEJ junctions enriched in irradiated cells.
