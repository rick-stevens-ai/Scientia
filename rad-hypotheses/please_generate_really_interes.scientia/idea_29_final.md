## Title

Exosomal γ-H2AX-Tagged eccDNA Functions as a Repair-Factor Sponge in Bystander Cells

## One Sentence Summary

Irradiated cells secrete eccDNA decorated with γ-H2AX that, when internalised, sequesters NHEJ proteins in recipient cells, impairing repair and promoting transformation.

## Paragraph Summary

Circle-seq identifies 200–800 bp eccDNAs enriched for γ-H2AX and Ku70. FRET-based proximity ligation in recipient cells demonstrates recruitment of 53BP1 to eccDNA instead of chromosomal breaks, doubling unrepaired DSBs and increasing soft-agar colony formation by ~3-fold.
