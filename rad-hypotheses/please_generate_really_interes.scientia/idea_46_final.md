## Title

IR-Inducible Micropeptidome Competes for BRCA1-BRCT and Skews Repair Toward NHEJ

## One Sentence Summary

≥10 radiation-upregulated lncRNA micropeptides harbouring pSer-(S/T)Q-E motifs displace BRCA1 from resected ends, globally reducing homologous recombination.

## Paragraph Summary

Ribo-seq/mass-spec reveal a cohort of micro-ORFs (30-60 aa) translated within 1 h of IR. Fluorescence polarisation shows peptides bind BRCT with IC50 ~ 2 µM, comparable to BACH1. CRISPRi against top three lncRNAs restores HR and lowers indel burden.
