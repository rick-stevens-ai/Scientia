## Title

Radiation-Induced cGAS-ΔN Variant Complexes with HP1α to Compact Chromatin and Evade Checkpoints

## One Sentence Summary

ATM-phosphorylated SRSF10 favours cGAS-ΔN splicing; cGAS-ΔN binds HP1α, raises H3K9me3 at breaks, and suppresses checkpoint signalling while mutations accumulate.

## Paragraph Summary

cGAS-ΔN isoform rises three-fold post-IR. GST-pull-down maps HP1α interaction to cGAS 145–210; over-expression cuts 53BP1 foci 40 % and boosts mutation burden; siRNA rescue reverses.
