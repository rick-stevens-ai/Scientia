## Title

Nuclear FASN-Mediated Histone Palmitoylation Creates Lipid Patches that Recruit 53BP1 for NHEJ Bias

## One Sentence Summary

IR-phosphorylated FASN enters nuclei and palmitoylates H2A/H2AX, generating lipid microdomains that anchor 53BP1 and favour NHEJ over HR.

## Paragraph Summary

Acyl-biotin exchange detects palmitoylated H2A on K119 within 30 min of 4 Gy. Super-res confocal shows co-localisation of FASN, palmitoyl-H2A and 53BP1 foci. FASN inhibition (TVB-2640) reduces 53BP1 foci and shifts repair to HR, lowering indel burden.
