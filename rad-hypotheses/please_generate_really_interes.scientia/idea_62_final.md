# Final Report: Idea 62

## Title

Palmitoylated V-ATPase V0a2 Inserts into Inner Nuclear Membrane, Acidifying Chromatin and Inhibiting Mismatch Repair

## One Sentence Summary

ROS-triggered palmitoylation escorts V0a2 to INM, lowering local pH, reducing MutSα activity and elevating mutation rates.

## Paragraph Summary

Immuno-EM shows INM-V0a2 2 h post-IR; pHluorin-H2B reports 0.4-unit drop. MutSα mismatch binding falls 60 % at pH 6.8; V0a2-Cys→Ala mutant fails to acidify and shows lower mutation signatures.
