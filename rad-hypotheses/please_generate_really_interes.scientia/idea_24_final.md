## Title

IR-Inducible Micropeptidome Screen Reveals BRCA1-Hijacking Peptides that Shift Repair Toward NHEJ

## One Sentence Summary

A group of lncRNA-encoded micropeptides induced by radiation compete for BRCA1-BRCT phospho-binding, globally reducing homologous recombination.

## Paragraph Summary

Instead of a single lncRNA, ribosome profiling identifies â‰¥10 IR-up-regulated micro-ORFs encoding phospho-(S/T)Q-E motifs. Synthetic peptides bind BRCA1-BRCT with affinities comparable to BACH1. Competition displaces BRCA1 from resected ends, forcing cells to rely on error-prone NHEJ.
