## Title

Radiation-Induced Proton Pump V-ATPase Nuclear Insertion Alters Chromatin pH Microdomains

## One Sentence Summary

IR drives V-ATPase subunit V0a2 into the inner nuclear membrane, locally acidifying chromatin and inactivating mismatch repair proteins, accelerating mutational accumulation.

## Paragraph Summary

Organelle proton pumps in the nucleus are unprecedented. We propose that ROS-activated palmitoylation of V0a2 escorts V-ATPase to the INM, where proton pumping lowers pH around heterochromatin. Mismatch repair enzymes, sensitive to pH, lose activity, fostering replication-associated mutations that initiate neoplasia.
