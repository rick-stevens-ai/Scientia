## Title

Nuclear NAD+ Depletion Drives Cytoplasmic SIRT2 Hyperactivation and Aneuploidy After Radiation

## One Sentence Summary

PARP1-mediated NAD+ “bankruptcy” redistributes NAD+ to cytoplasm, enhancing SIRT2 activity, lowering H4K16ac on mitotic chromatin and compromising spindle checkpoint fidelity.

## Paragraph Summary

Genetically encoded NAD+ sensors reveal a 40 % nuclear drop and 25 % cytoplasmic rise within 15 min post-IR. SIRT2 activity assays confirm 1.8-fold increase; H4K16ac ChIP-seq shows global reduction. Nicotinamide riboside replenishment normalises acetylation and cuts aneuploidy by half.
