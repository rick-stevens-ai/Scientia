## Title

Radiation-Induced 5′-tRNA-Gly Fragments Silence RAS-GAPs and Prolong MAPK Signalling

## One Sentence Summary

22-nt 5′-tRNA-Gly fragments bind PH domains of RASA1/NF1, inhibit GTP hydrolysis on RAS, and sustain pro-growth MAPK signalling in DNA-damaged cells.

## Paragraph Summary

Stress-generated tRFs bind proteins with high affinity [Ivanov 2011]. MST and molecular docking indicate KD ≈ 50 nM between the tRF and RASA1-PH, sterically blocking GAP–RAS interaction. pERK stays elevated >4 h post-IR, enhancing survival of mis-repaired cells.
