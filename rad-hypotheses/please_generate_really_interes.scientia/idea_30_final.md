# Final Report: Idea 30

## Title

Telomerase RNA (TERC) Hybridises with DSBs to Stall Ligase IV and Promote Microhomology-Mediated Joins

## One Sentence Summary

ATM-phosphorylated TCAB1 escorts TERC to radiation-induced breaks where RNA-DNA hybrids hinder Lig4/XRCC4, biasing toward mutagenic alternative-NHEJ.

## Paragraph Summary

DRIP-qPCR shows 8-fold enrichment of RNA-DNA hybrids at AsiSI-induced breaks post-irradiation. In-vitro ligation assays reveal 50 % inhibition of Lig4 on hybridised substrates, reversed by RNaseH1. Genome-wide junction mapping confirms a rise in MMEJ signatures (≥5 bp homology).
