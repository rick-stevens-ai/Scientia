## Title

NAD+ Bankruptcy After Radiation Hyperactivates Cytoplasmic SIRT2 to Promote Aneuploid Mitosis

## One Sentence Summary

Excessive PARP1 activity depletes nuclear NAD+, redistributing the metabolite pool to cytoplasm where SIRT2 deacetylates H4K16, impairing spindle checkpoint fidelity.

## Paragraph Summary

Nuclear-cytoplasmic NAD+ gradients shape signaling. IR-driven PARP1 consumes NAD+, causing compensatory cytoplasmic enrichment that boosts SIRT2 activity. Hypoacetylated H4K16 in mitosis weakens kinetochore tension sensing, leading to chromosome mis-segregation and early genome instability.
