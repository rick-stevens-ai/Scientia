## Title

Ku80 Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence Creates a ROS Amplifier Loop After IR

## One Sentence Summary

Phosphorylation-exposed ΦxxYxxR motif directs Ku70/80 to Complex-I subunit NDUFS2, boosting superoxide that feeds back to nuclear mutagenesis.

## Paragraph Summary

Bioinformatic scanning uncovered a cryptic amphipathic helix in Ku80 unveiled by IR-driven Ser577 phosphorylation. Docking and co-IP show phospho-Ku80 binds NDUFS2, uncoupling electron flow and tripling mitochondrial ROS. Oxidative lesions accumulate during S-phase, overwhelming BER and elevating C > A transversions.

## Key Ideas and Implementation

This section provides a detailed explanation of the key ideas and how they could be implemented or tested.

### Implementation and Testing Approach

1) Mutate ΦxxYxxR (ΔMTS-Ku80) and track mito-localisation; 2) peptide pulldown & ITC for Ku80-NDUFS2 binding; 3) mitoSOX, Seahorse respirometry; 4) 8-oxoG ELISA & duplex-seq; 5) transformation frequency in WT vs ΔMTS cells.
