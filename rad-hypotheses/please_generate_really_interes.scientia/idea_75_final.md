## Title

Nuclear NAD+ Bankruptcy Hyper-activates Cytoplasmic SIRT2 and Drives Aneuploid Mitosis

## One Sentence Summary

PARP1-mediated nuclear NAD+ depletion redistributes NAD+ to cytoplasm, enhancing SIRT2 activity, lowering H4K16ac and compromising spindle-checkpoint tension sensing.

## Paragraph Summary

Genetically encoded sensors reveal 40 % nuclear drop and 25 % cytoplasmic gain 15 min post-IR. SIRT2 activity up 1.8-fold; nicotinamide riboside or AGK2 restores acetylation and halves aneuploidy.
