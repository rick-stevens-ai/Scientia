## Title

Oxidative Fe–S Cluster Loss in Pol δ Couples Error-Prone Replication with Ferroptosis Escape

## One Sentence Summary

ROS-mediated Fe–S loss halves Pol δ fidelity while GPX4 up-regulation suppresses ferroptosis, allowing mutant clones to survive.

## Paragraph Summary

EPR indicates 40 % Fe–S loss by 30 min post-6 Gy. Apo-Pol δ mis-incorporation rate rises 6-fold; lipidomics shows surviving clones elevate GPX4 and lower phospholipid peroxides.
