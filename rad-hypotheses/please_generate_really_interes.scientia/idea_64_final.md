## Title

Ku80 Mitochondrial-Targeting Helix Generates a ROS Feed-Forward Loop After IR

## One Sentence Summary

Ser577-phosphorylation unmasks a ΦxxYxxR amphipathic helix in Ku80 that docks to Complex-I subunit NDUFS2, tripling superoxide output that feeds back to nuclear DNA damage.

## Paragraph Summary

Ku70/80 cytoplasmic re-localisation is known [Friedman 2011], but its mitochondrial function remained speculative. Structural docking and immuno-IP show phosphorylated Ku80 binds NDUFS2, destabilising electron flow. The ensuing mitochondrial ROS diffuses or signals to the nucleus, raising 8-oxoG during S-phase and favouring mutagenic repair.
