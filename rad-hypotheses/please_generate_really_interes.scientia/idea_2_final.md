## Title

Mitochondrial Ku70/80 ROS Amplifier Loop in Radiation-Driven Genomic Instability

## One Sentence Summary

After irradiation, Ku70/80 translocates to mitochondria, binds Complex I, and amplifies superoxide production that feeds back to nuclear DNA damage and mutagenesis.

## Paragraph Summary

Ku70/80 is canonically nuclear, yet stress-induced cytoplasmic shuttling has been observed. We hypothesize that radiation fosters Ku80 phosphorylation, exposing a mitochondrial-targeting motif that docks onto NDUFS2 of Complex I, destabilizing electron flow and escalating ROS. Elevated ROS produces additional oxidative lesions during S-phase, overwhelming repair and fostering oncogenic mutations.
