## Title

Methylglyoxal Glycation of NBS1-FHA Curtails MRN Retention and Promotes Translocations

## One Sentence Summary

Radiation-driven methylglyoxal glycates NBS1-R28/R43, shortening MRN chromatin half-life, truncating ATM signalling and elevating translocation frequency.

## Paragraph Summary

LC-MS/MS detects MG-hydroimidazolone adducts on R28/R43. FRAP shows MRN residence time drops from 45 s to 18 s; Hi-C finds 2-fold rise in inter-chromosomal joins, reversed by aminoguanidine.
