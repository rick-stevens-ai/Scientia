# Final Report: Idea 59

## Title

K63-Ubiquitinated XRCC4 Bridges TGF-β Receptor I to Drive EMT After IR

## One Sentence Summary

TRAF6-mediated K63-Ub on XRCC4 exposes an L45-like patch binding TGF-βRI, activating SMAD2/3 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

## Paragraph Summary

XRCC4-K210R mutant fails to bind TGF-βRI after IR; SMAD-luciferase rises 3-fold in WT. Snail and Vimentin up-regulation drives invasion; TRAF6 KO or K210R abolish metastasis in orthotopic model.
