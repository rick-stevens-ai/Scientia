## Title

ESCRT-III/p62 Autophagy Axis Degrades Mis-localised 53BP1 After Nuclear Envelope Rupture

## One Sentence Summary

CHMP7-mediated repair recruits p62-linked LC3 to cytoplasmic 53BP1, selectively degrading it and lowering nuclear NHEJ capacity.

## Paragraph Summary

Lattice light-sheet imaging captures GFP-53BP1 extrusion with CHMP7. p62-KO stabilises 53BP1 and restores NHEJ; combined loss of 53BP1 and BRCA1 exacerbates instability.
