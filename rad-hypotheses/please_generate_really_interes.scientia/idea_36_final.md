# Final Report: Idea 36

## Title

Radiation-Stabilised R-Loop Clusters Recruit FEN1 via RNA-Binding Surface to Generate Fragile Sites and Chromothripsis

## One Sentence Summary

Phosphorylated FEN1 gains affinity for RNA:DNA hybrids, incising both strands at clustered R-loops, creating double-cuts that seed chromothriptic rearrangements.

## Paragraph Summary

In-vitro EMSA shows IR-mimetic phosphorylated FEN1 (S187E) binds R-loops (KD ~ 0.5 µM). DRIP-ChIP reveals co-occupancy at >1000 sites. Long-read nanopore sequencing detects local shattered chromosomal segments in FEN1-WT but not catalytic-dead E160D cells.
