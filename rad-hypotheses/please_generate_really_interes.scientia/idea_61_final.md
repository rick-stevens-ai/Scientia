## Title

Radiation-Induced cGAS-ΔN Splice Variant Complexes with HP1α to Compact Chromatin and Evade Checkpoints

## One Sentence Summary

ATM-phosphorylated SRSF10 promotes cGAS-ΔN; the variant binds HP1α, elevates H3K9me3 around breaks and masks lesions from checkpoint sensors.

## Paragraph Summary

Isoform-specific RT-qPCR shows 3-fold cGAS-ΔN rise. GST-pull-down maps HP1α interaction to cGAS 145–210. cGAS-ΔN over-expression reduces 53BP1 foci 40 % and increases mutation load; siRNA rescue restores checkpoint activation.
