## Title

Exosomal γ-H2AX-Tagged eccDNA Sequesters NHEJ Factors in Bystander Cells

## One Sentence Summary

Irradiated-cell exosomes deliver γ-H2AX-decorated eccDNA that sponges Ku70/53BP1 in recipient cells, doubling unrepaired DSBs and transformation frequency.

## Paragraph Summary

Circle-seq identifies 200–800 bp eccDNA enriched for γ-H2AX and Ku70. FRET-PLA in bystander cells visualises Ku70-eccDNA complexes; GW4869 or ALIX-KO blocks transfer and rescues repair.
