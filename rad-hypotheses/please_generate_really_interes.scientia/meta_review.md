### 1. Idea (ELO: 1262.5)

**Title**: Nuclear NAD+ Depletion Drives Cytoplasmic SIRT2 Hyperactivation and Aneuploidy After Radiation

**Key Idea**: PARP1-mediated NAD+ “bankruptcy” redistributes NAD+ to cytoplasm, enhancing SIRT2 activity, lowering H4K16ac on mitotic chromatin and compromising spindle checkpoint fidelity.

**Paragraph**: Genetically encoded NAD+ sensors reveal a 40 % nuclear drop and 25 % cytoplasmic rise within 15 min post-IR. SIRT2 activity assays confirm 1.8-fold increase; H4K16ac ChIP-seq shows global reduction. Nicotinamide riboside replenishment normalises acetylation and cuts aneuploidy by half.

**Approach**: (i) Cambronne NAMPT-biosensors; (ii) SIRT2 fluorogenic substrate assays; (iii) SIRT2-specific inhibitor AGK2; (iv) chromosome spreads; (v) NR supplementation rescue.

### 2. Idea (ELO: 1236.2)

**Title**: Radiation-Induced Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation of p53–YAP Complex Drives Early Oncogenic Transcription

**Key Idea**: Ionizing radiation triggers a previously unrecognized liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) between p53 and YAP that transiently sequesters DNA-damage checkpoints while activating pro-proliferative YAP targets.

**Paragraph**: LLPS of DNA-damage factors has been reported for 53BP1 and FUS, but p53 itself has not been implicated in condensate formation with mechanotransducers such as YAP. We propose that clustered γ-H2AX foci nucleate multivalent interactions between the p53 C-terminal domain and the low-complexity region of YAP, forming nuclear condensates that delay p53-mediated arrest while YAP concurrently activates genes favoring survival and proliferation. This “checkpoint masking” condensate could provide the temporal niche for survival of cells with mis-repaired genomes, initiating tumorigenesis.

**Approach**: (i) Use live-cell fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of GFP-p53 and mCherry-YAP after 4 Gy radiation; (ii) disrupt condensates with 1,6-hexanediol or point mutations in low-complexity regions; (iii) RNA-seq to assess YAP-target activation; (iv) clonogenic transformation assays in wild-type vs. condensate-deficient mutants.

### 3. Idea (ELO: 1222.0)

**Title**: XRCC4 K63-Ubiquitination Links DNA Repair to TGF-β Receptor Activation and EMT

**Key Idea**: Post-IR, TRAF6-mediated K63-ubiquitination of XRCC4 promotes its interaction with TGF-β receptor I, directly activating SMAD2/3 and driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

**Paragraph**: TRAF6 ubiquitin chains are known in receptor signaling; their role on repair factors is novel. We propose K63-Ub chains on XRCC4 expose a L45-like motif recognized by TGF-βRI, enabling nuclear-to-membrane crosstalk. Persistent SMAD signaling after DNA repair biases cells toward EMT, facilitating malignant progression.

**Approach**: (i) Ub-mutant XRCC4; (ii) SMAD phosphorylation assays; (iii) EMT marker qPCR; (iv) invasion assays.

### 4. Idea (ELO: 1218.7)

**Title**: NAD+ Bankruptcy After Radiation Hyperactivates Cytoplasmic SIRT2 to Promote Aneuploid Mitosis

**Key Idea**: Excessive PARP1 activity depletes nuclear NAD+, redistributing the metabolite pool to cytoplasm where SIRT2 deacetylates H4K16, impairing spindle checkpoint fidelity.

**Paragraph**: Nuclear-cytoplasmic NAD+ gradients shape signaling. IR-driven PARP1 consumes NAD+, causing compensatory cytoplasmic enrichment that boosts SIRT2 activity. Hypoacetylated H4K16 in mitosis weakens kinetochore tension sensing, leading to chromosome mis-segregation and early genome instability.

**Approach**: (i) NAD+ biosensor imaging; (ii) SIRT2 inhibitors; (iii) chromosomal spreads for aneuploidy; (iv) rescue with NAD+ precursors.

**Key References**: [Gibson 2016 Nat Metab] – NAD+ compartmentalization; [Liu 2017 Nat Commun] – SIRT2 mitotic roles.

### 5. Idea (ELO: 1215.1)

**Title**: Radiation-Enhanced R-Loop Clustering Creates FEN1-Dependent Fragile Sites

**Key Idea**: IR stabilizes RNA:DNA hybrids at replication forks; aberrant FEN1 binding to clustered R-loops generates double-cut fragments conducive to chromothripsis.

**Paragraph**: R-loops are co-transcriptional structures linked to genome instability. We hypothesize γ-H2AX recruits FEN1 to R-loops instead of Okazaki flaps, cleaving both strands and forming double cuts. Clustering of such events along chromosomes predisposes to shattering and rejoining characteristic of chromothripsis seen in cancers.

**Approach**: (i) DRIP-seq after IR; (ii) FEN1 ChIP; (iii) FEN1 catalytic mutants; (iv) long-read sequencing for chromothriptic patterns.

**Key References**: [Crossley 2019 Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol] – R-loops; [Zhang 2015 Cell] – chromothripsis in cancer.

## Meta-Review Analysis

META-REVIEW OF TOP FIVE PROPOSALS ON RADIATION-INDUCED GENOME INSTABILITY

────────────────────────
1. Nuclear NAD+ Depletion Drives Cytoplasmic SIRT2 Hyper-activation and Aneuploidy After Radiation  
Key hypothesis & impact  
• Ionizing radiation (IR) triggers PARP1-dependent “NAD+ bankruptcy” that siphons NAD+ from nucleus to cytoplasm (~40 % ↓ nucleus, 25 % ↑ cytoplasm).  
• Elevated cytoplasmic NAD+ boosts SIRT2 activity (1.8-fold), causing H4K16 hypo-acetylation on mitotic chromatin, spindle-checkpoint failure, and aneuploidy.  
• Replenishing NAD+ with nicotinamide riboside (NR) halves aneuploidy, nominating metabolic support as a radioprotective strategy.  
Strengths  
✓ Quantitative biosensor data (Cambronne NAMPT sensors) directly visualize compartmental NAD+ flux [Cambronne 2016 Science].  
✓ Mechanistic chain from metabolite change → enzyme activity → chromatin mark → mitotic error is experimentally testable and therapeutically actionable (NR, AGK2).  
Limitations  
• Temporal window (15 min) may miss late compensatory pathways (e.g., NMNAT nuclear import).  
• PARP1 hyper-activation varies by cell type; findings may not generalize to low-PARP tumors.  
Next steps  
1. Use CRISPR knock-in SIRT2 activity reporters to confirm real-time enzyme kinetics during mitosis.  
2. Test NR or PARP1 “caloric restriction” in 3D organoids and in vivo IR models.  
3. Employ isotope-tracing of NAD+ precursors to validate actual cytoplasmic import rather than de-novo synthesis.

────────────────────────
2. Radiation-Induced Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) of p53–YAP Complex Drives Early Oncogenic Transcription  
Key hypothesis & impact  
• IR nucleates an LLPS condensate composed of p53 C-terminal domain and YAP low-complexity region, transiently masking p53 checkpoints while unleashing YAP pro-survival genes.  
• Provides a time-restricted “oncogenic window” that could seed tumor initiation after radiotherapy or space radiation exposure.  
Strengths  
✓ Builds on growing LLPS field [Banani 2017 Nature Rev Mol Cell Biol]; merges DNA-damage signaling with mechanotransduction.  
✓ Straightforward visualization (live-cell FRAP, 1,6-hexanediol sensitivity) and mutational disruption enable clear go/no-go testing.  
✓ Links molecular biophysics (condensates) to functional outcome (clonogenic survival).  
Limitations  
• p53 and YAP levels are highly cell-contextual; LLPS might occur only in cells with overexpressed YAP or mutant p53.  
• Hexanediol can produce off-target effects on other condensates.  
Next steps  
1. Map biophysical parameters (saturation concentration, viscosity) of p53-YAP droplets in vitro.  
2. Perform single-cell RNA-seq immediately after IR to capture transient transcriptional waves.  
3. Validate in mouse intestinal crypts where p53-YAP crosstalk regulates regeneration.

────────────────────────
3. XRCC4 K63-Ubiquitination Links DNA Repair to TGF-β Receptor Activation and EMT  
Key hypothesis & impact  
• TRAF6 builds K63-Ub chains on XRCC4 post-IR, unveiling a motif that directly binds TGF-βRI, thereby activating SMAD2/3 and driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).  
• Mechanistic bridge between DSB repair and pro-metastatic signaling; could explain radiotherapy-induced fibrosis and secondary malignancy.  
Strengths  
✓ Conceptually novel nuclear-to-membrane crosstalk; extends TRAF6’s repertoire from receptor signaling to DSB repair [Dou 2010 Nature].  
✓ Feasible validation via XRCC4 Ub-site mutants, SMAD phosphorylation assays, and EMT phenotyping.  
Limitations  
• Biochemical interaction between XRCC4 and TGF-βRI must occur across nuclear membrane—requires demonstration of cytoplasmic pool or nuclear egress.  
• TRAF6 has multiple substrates; specificity for XRCC4 needs rigorous competition assays.  
Next steps  
1. Live-cell proximity labeling (TurboID-XRCC4) to chart transient interactome after IR.  
2. Determine whether nuclear export inhibitors block SMAD activation, confirming spatial route.  
3. Test EMT and invasion in organotypic cultures and syngeneic mouse xenografts ± TRAF6 inhibitor.

────────────────────────
4. NAD+ Bankruptcy Hyper-activates Cytoplasmic SIRT2 to Promote Aneuploid Mitosis (Variant)  
(Conceptually overlaps Idea 1 but emphasizes kinetochore tension sensing.)  
Distinctive angles  
• Focuses on kinetochore tension-sensing defects via H4K16 hypo-acetylation [Liu 2017].  
• Highlights potential use of SIRT2 inhibitors as “aneuploidy shields” during radiotherapy.  
Strengths & added value  
✓ Provides complementary readouts (kinetochore stretch assays, SAC timing) that enrich the mechanistic picture.  
✓ Pharmacological modulation (AGK2, SirReal2) could be rapidly translated to radiosensitization studies.  
Limitations  
• Redundant with Proposal 1; could be merged into a unified project to avoid duplication.  
Next steps  
• Combine proposals 1 & 4 into a dual-aim study: metabolic (NR) vs. enzymatic (SIRT2) intervention in the same models.  
Added literature  
[Schuster 2021 EMBO Rep] SIRT2 substrates in mitosis; [Zhang 2019 Nat Struct Mol Biol] NAD+ flux in chromatin context.

────────────────────────
5. Radiation-Enhanced R-Loop Clustering Creates FEN1-Dependent Fragile Sites  
Key hypothesis & impact  
• IR stabilizes RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) near replication forks; γ-H2AX mis-recruits FEN1, which cleaves both strands of clustered R-loops, producing double-cut fragments that seed chromothripsis.  
• Offers a mechanistic entry point to prevent catastrophic chromosomal shattering in irradiated tissues.  
Strengths  
✓ Integrates transcription-replication conflicts with endonuclease mis-targeting (FEN1), a plausible route to complex genome rearrangements [Zhang 2015 Cell].  
✓ DRIP-seq, FEN1-ChIP, and long-read sequencing provide orthogonal evidence streams.  
Limitations  
• FEN1 usually resides in nucleus during S-phase; γ-H2AX-mediated “mis-recruitment” is speculative—requires direct visualization.  
• Chromothripsis detection demands large cell numbers or single-cell long-read platforms—technically intensive.  
Next steps  
1. Use super-resolution microscopy to co-localize FEN1 with R-loop markers (S9.6 antibody) after IR.  
2. Employ FEN1 catalytic-dead knock-in mice to test chromothripsis frequency in vivo after whole-body irradiation.  
3. Screen small-molecule R-loop resolvases (e.g., RNaseH1 agonists) for radioprotection.

CROSS-CUTTING THEMES & SYNERGIES  

Metabolite relays: Proposals 1 & 4 underscore how nuclear metabolite depletion reprograms cytoplasmic enzymes, paralleling Proposal 3’s ubiquitin relay and Proposal 5’s R-loop to DSB relay.

Spatiotemporal condensates: LLPS in Proposal 2 conceptually aligns with NAD+ “compartment” shifts and R-loop clustering—suggesting phase behavior and local concentration effects as unifying principles.

Genome instability trajectories: Aneuploidy (1/4), EMT (3), chromothripsis (5) represent successive tiers of instability and transformation—studies could be integrated into longitudinal models.

Methodological overlaps:  
• Live-cell imaging (NAD+ sensors, condensate FRAP, FEN1 localization).  
• Omics (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, DRIP-seq) can be multiplexed across projects to reduce cost.  
• Chemical biology (PARP, SIRT2, TRAF6, RNaseH1 modulators) provides convergent therapeutic levers.

────────────────────────
PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION & COLLABORATIONS  

• Metabolism–Chromatin axis (Ideas 1/4): Partner with NAD+ biology groups (e.g., Verdin lab) and mitotic error specialists (e.g., Cleveland).  
• Phase-separation (Idea 2): Collaborate with biophysicists experienced in condensate rheology (e.g., Brangwynne).  
• Ubiquitin-Signaling crosstalk (Idea 3): Connect with ubiquitinomics mass-spec cores for K63-Ub site mapping.  
• R-loop/Replication stress (Idea 5): Engage RNA biology consortia and long-read sequencing centers.  
• In vivo radiobiology: Use shared small-animal irradiation platforms; integrate proposals into a unified mouse pipeline (acute vs. fractionated doses).

────────────────────────
CONCLUDING SYNTHESIS  

Together, these proposals illuminate how radiation perturbs nuclear organization, metabolism, and signaling to accelerate genome instability along multiple axes—metabolic (NAD+), biophysical (LLPS), post-translational (K63-Ub), and nucleic-acid (R-loops). The combined program offers a cohesive framework to identify early, targetable events that precede overt transformation. Prioritizing shared assays and cross-validation among projects will maximize feasibility and translational impact.
