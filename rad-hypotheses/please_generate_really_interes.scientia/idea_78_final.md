## Title

Phosphorylated FEN1 Binds R-Loops, Generating Fragile Sites and Chromothripsis

## One Sentence Summary

IR-mimetic FEN1-S187E gains RNA-DNA hybrid affinity, incising both strands at clustered R-loops and triggering chromothriptic shattering.

## Paragraph Summary

EMSA KD ≈ 0.5 µM for S187E FEN1-R-loop. DRIP-ChIP shows co-occupancy at >1 000 sites; nanopore sequencing uncovers shattered segments in WT but not catalytic-dead E160D cells.
