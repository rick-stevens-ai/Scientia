## Title

ERK-Phosphorylated ALDH1A1 Anchors to ATM to Generate Retinoic Acid and Stemness at DSBs

## One Sentence Summary

ALDH1A1-S267 phosphorylation enables ATM binding, boosting local retinoic acid that up-regulates SOX2/NANOG and cancer-stem traits.

## Paragraph Summary

PLA peaks at 1 h post-IR; chromatin-bound retinoic acid rises 3-fold. S267A mutant abolishes sphere-forming capacity without altering catalytic activity.
