## Title

Radiation-Triggered p53–YAP Phase-Separated “Checkpoint-Masking” Condensates

## One Sentence Summary

Ionising radiation nucleates γ-H2AX–anchored liquid–liquid phase-separation (LLPS) between p53 and YAP that transiently excludes p53 co-repressors, delays cell-cycle arrest, and boosts pro-survival YAP transcription.

## Paragraph Summary

Recent work shows p53 can participate in transcriptional condensates [Sabari 2020; Kuroda 2017], while YAP LC-regions readily phase-separate under mechanical stress. We posit that clustered γ-H2AX foci provide a multivalent scaffold where p53 C-terminal lysines and YAP low-complexity repeats co-assemble. The condensate sterically blocks p300/HDAC1 from engaging p53, yet retains TEAD-bound YAP, producing a 1–2 h “safe window” in which damaged cells proliferate before checkpoints are re-instated.

## Key Ideas and Implementation

This section provides a detailed explanation of the key ideas and how they could be implemented or tested.

### Implementation and Testing Approach

(i) In-vitro droplet reconstitution with purified p53/YAP ± nucleosomal DNA; (ii) live-cell FRAP of GFP-p53 & mCherry-YAP after 4 Gy; (iii) disruption with 1,6-hexanediol, p53(K→A) or YAP(ΔLCR) mutants; (iv) ChIP-seq and RNA-seq for YAP targets during condensate lifetime; (v) clonogenic survival of condensate-competent vs-deficient cells.
