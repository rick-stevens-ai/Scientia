## Title

Palmitoylated V-ATPase V0a2 Inserts into Inner Nuclear Membrane, Acidifying Chromatin and Inhibiting Mismatch Repair

## One Sentence Summary

ROS-triggered palmitoylation escorts V0a2 to the inner nuclear membrane, lowering local pH and reducing MutSα mismatch-recognition activity, thereby elevating mutation rates.

## Paragraph Summary

Immuno-EM detects INM-V0a2 2 h post-IR; pHluorin-H2B reports a 0.4-unit drop. In-vitro MutSα binding falls 60 % at pH 6.8. V0a2-Cys→Ala mutant fails to acidify and shows diminished mutation signatures.
