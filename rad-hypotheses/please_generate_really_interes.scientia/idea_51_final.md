## Title

Exosomal γ-H2AX-Tagged eccDNA Sequesters NHEJ Proteins in Bystander Cells

## One Sentence Summary

Irradiated-cell exosomes deliver γ-H2AX-decorated eccDNA that sponges Ku70/53BP1 in recipient cells, doubling unrepaired breaks.

## Paragraph Summary

Circle-seq finds 200-800 bp eccDNA enriched for γ-H2AX and Ku70. FRET-PLA confirms Ku70 recruitment to eccDNA in bystander cells; GW4869 or ALIX CRISPR blocks transfer and restores repair.
