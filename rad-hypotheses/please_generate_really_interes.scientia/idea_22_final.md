# Final Report: Idea 22

## Title

Ku70/80 Mitochondrial Relocation Forms a ROS-Amplifying Feed-Back Loop After IR

## One Sentence Summary

Phosphorylated Ku80 exposes a cryptic mitochondrial-targeting sequence that directs Ku70/80 to Complex-I subunit NDUFS2, enhancing superoxide production that feeds back to nuclear DNA damage.

## Paragraph Summary

Bioinformatic scanning reveals an IR-exposed “ΦxxYxxR” amphipathic helix in Ku80, conserved in metazoa. Docking onto NDUFS2 destabilises electron transfer, elevating mitochondrial ROS that diffuses or signals back to nuclei, creating secondary oxidative lesions during replication and promoting mutagenesis.
