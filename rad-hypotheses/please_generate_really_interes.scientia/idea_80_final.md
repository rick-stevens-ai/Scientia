## Title

RPA-Coated Linear mtDNA Translocates via Importin-β to Seed NUMT Insertions at DSBs

## One Sentence Summary

IR-released linear mtDNA binds RPA, translocates through nuclear pores using importin-β/XPOT, and integrates into chromosomal breaks by NHEJ.

## Paragraph Summary

PicoGreen-labelled mtDNA enters nuclei within 30 min of IR; RPA-S33A mutant blocks import. Nanopore sequencing detects de-novo NUMTs flanked by NHEJ junctions enriched in irradiated cells.
