## Title

ESCRT-III/Autophagy Axis Degrades Mislocalised 53BP1 After Nuclear Envelope Rupture

## One Sentence Summary

CHMP7-mediated repair recruits p62-linked LC3, selectively degrading cytoplasmic 53BP1 and lowering nuclear NHEJ capacity.

## Paragraph Summary

Lattice-light-sheet imaging captures GFP-53BP1 extrusion with CHMP7; p62 KO stabilises 53BP1 and restores NHEJ. Loss of both 53BP1 and BRCA1 inflates genome instability.
