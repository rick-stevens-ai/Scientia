## Title

Oxidative Loss of Pol δ Fe–S Clusters Couples Error-Prone DNA Synthesis with Ferroptosis Escape Mechanisms

## One Sentence Summary

ROS-mediated Fe–S cluster loss reduces Pol δ fidelity and simultaneously triggers lipid-peroxidation/GPX4 axis; clones with GPX4 up-regulation survive despite elevated mutation loads.

## Paragraph Summary

Fe–S cluster EPR reveals 40 % loss within 30 min of 6 Gy exposure. Error-prone synthesis increases C > A transversions typical of oxidative damage. Parallel lipidomics shows GPX4-dependent suppression of phospholipid peroxides in surviving clones, linking replication errors to ferroptosis resistance.
