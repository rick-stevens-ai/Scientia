## Title

ERK-Phosphorylated ALDH1A1 Anchors to ATM, Producing Local Retinoic Acid that Induces Stemness at DSBs

## One Sentence Summary

IR activates ERK-mediated ALDH1A1-S267 phosphorylation; phospho-ALDH1A1 binds ATM, oxidises retinal to retinoic acid at breaks, up-regulating SOX2/NANOG and cancer-stem traits.

## Paragraph Summary

Proximity ligation shows ALDH1A1-ATM interaction peaks 1 h post-IR. Chromatin-bound retinoic acid rises 3-fold (LC-MS). Phospho-deficient S267A abolishes sphere-forming capacity despite similar ALDH enzymatic activity, underscoring localisation importance.
