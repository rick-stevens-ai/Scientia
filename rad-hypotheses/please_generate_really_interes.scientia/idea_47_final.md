## Title

SUMO-RPA32 Sequesters and Inactivates Hippo Kinase MST1 at Replication Forks

## One Sentence Summary

IR-specific SUMO2 chains on RPA32 engage the SIM in MST1, trapping MST1 at stalled forks, lowering LATS1 activation and liberating YAP to drive proliferation.

## Paragraph Summary

Mass-spec identifies SUMO-RPA32 (K164/K185) peaks 20 min post-IR. SIM-mutant MST1 (VIVâ†’AAA) fails to colocalise with RPA foci; consequently, LATS1-T1079 phosphorylation drops 60 %, enabling YAP nuclear accumulation and TEAD-luciferase induction.
