## Title

ROS-Triggered Palmitoylation Targets V-ATPase V0a2 to Inner Nuclear Membrane, Acidifying Chromatin and Inhibiting Mismatch Repair

## One Sentence Summary

Oxidative stress palmitoylates V0a2, enabling importin-α–mediated transit to INM where proton pumping lowers pH microdomains, reducing MSH2/MSH6 activity and elevating mutation rates.

## Paragraph Summary

Immuno-EM shows INM V0a2 within 2 h of IR; nuclear pH nanosensors record a 0.4-unit drop locally. In-vitro MutSα mismatch binding decreases 60 % under pH 6.8 vs. 7.4.  V0a2-Cys→Ala palmitoylation mutants fail to localise or acidify and have lower mutational signatures.
