## Title

DNA-Protein Crosslink Neo-Antigens Induce IL-10-Rich Germinal Centres and IgG4 Switch

## One Sentence Summary

DPCs released after IR are presented by dendritic cells, expanding Tfh-10 cells, promoting IgG4 CSR and dampening anti-tumour immunity.

## Paragraph Summary

DPC immunisation in IgG4-humanised mice elevates serum IgG4 5-fold; GC scRNA-seq shows IL-10high B and Tfh-10 expansion. IgG4 blocks FcγRIIA, reducing ADCC against irradiated tumour cells.
