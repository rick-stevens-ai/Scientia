## Title

Radiation-Induced Lysosomal Exocytosis Releases Cathepsin-Cleaved HMGB1 that Drives PARP1 Hyper-Activation in Bystander Cells

## One Sentence Summary

IR prompts lysosomal Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, releasing truncated HMGB1 that translocates into neighbouring cells, binds chromatin and hyper-activates PARP1, causing replication stress and genomic instability even without direct irradiation.

## Paragraph Summary

Exocytosed 25-kDa HMGB1Î”C retains PARP1-binding A-box domains. Uptake by bystander cells increases PAR-polymer levels 3-fold, depleting nuclear NAD+ and precipitating replication fork collapse. Blocking lysosomal fusion with vacuolin-1 or PARP1 with olaparib abrogates the bystander DNA damage.
