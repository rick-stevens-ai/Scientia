## Title

Damage-Induced tRNA-Fragment Signaling Couples DNA Repair Failure to RAS Activation

## One Sentence Summary

Radiation-generated 5′ tRNA fragments bind and inhibit GAPs, prolonging RAS-GTP signaling and promoting early neoplastic growth.

## Paragraph Summary

tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are stress-responsive regulators of signaling; however, their role in DNA-damage contexts is unknown. We posit that DICER-processed 5′-Gly-tRFs accumulate after radiation, directly binding RASA1 and NF1, blocking GTP hydrolysis on RAS. Sustained RAS-GTP boosts MAPK signaling in cells surviving mis-repaired breaks, favoring clonal expansion.
