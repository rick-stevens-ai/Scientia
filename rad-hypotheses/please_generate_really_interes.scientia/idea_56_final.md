## Title

SENP3-Cleaved Nucleolin Fragment Stabilises KRAS-GTP After rDNA Damage

## One Sentence Summary

IR-triggered SENP3 cleavage after R615 releases an RGG-rich fragment (NCL-F) that binds KRAS and impedes GAP access, sustaining MAPK signalling.

## Paragraph Summary

ITC shows NCL-F-KRAS KD â‰ˆ 200 nM. SENP3 KD or RGG-mut NCL-F reduces pERK and colony formation by 60 %. Structural models predict electrostatic RGG-switch I interaction.
