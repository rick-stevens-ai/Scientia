## Title

Radiation-Induced 5′-tRNA-Gly Fragments Inhibit RAS-GAPs to Sustain MAPK Signalling

## One Sentence Summary

22-nt 5′-tRNA-Gly fragments bind RASA1/NF1 PH domains, block GTP hydrolysis on RAS, and extend pro-growth signalling in irradiated cells.

## Paragraph Summary

Small-RNA-seq identifies a sharp rise in 5′-tRNA-Gly fragments 30 min post-IR. MST assays show KD ≈ 50 nM for fragment–RASA1 binding, sterically displacing KRAS. Sustained pERK enables colony outgrowth from DNA-damaged clones.
