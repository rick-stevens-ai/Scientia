# Final Report: Idea 60

## Title

RPA-Coated Linear mtDNA Uses Importin-β/XPOT to Seed NUMT Insertions at DSBs

## One Sentence Summary

IR-released linear mtDNA binds RPA, translocates through nuclear pores and integrates into chromosomal breaks by NHEJ, creating NUMTs.

## Paragraph Summary

PicoGreen-labelled mtDNA enters nuclei within 30 min; RPA-S33A mutant blocks import. Nanopore sequencing detects new NUMTs flanked by NHEJ junctions enriched in irradiated cells.
