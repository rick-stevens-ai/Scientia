## Title

DNA–Protein Crosslink Neo-Antigens Skew B-Cell Responses Toward Immunosuppressive IgG4

## One Sentence Summary

Unique neo-antigens formed by IR-induced DNA–protein crosslinks elicit an IgG4-dominant humoral response that suppresses anti-tumor immunity, aiding tumor outgrowth.

## Paragraph Summary

DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are bulky lesions; their immunogenicity remains unexplored. We propose DPCs released during apoptotic clearance are taken up by APCs, driving IL-10–rich environments that favor IgG4 CSR in B cells. IgG4 competes for Fcγ receptors, dampening macrophage tumor surveillance.
