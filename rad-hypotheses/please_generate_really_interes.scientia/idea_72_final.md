## Title

TERC RNA–DNA Hybrids Stall Ligase IV and Promote Microhomology-Mediated Joins

## One Sentence Summary

ATM-phosphorylated TCAB1 delivers TERC to DSBs, where hybrids impede Lig4/XRCC4, biasing repair toward mutagenic MMEJ.

## Paragraph Summary

DRIP-seq shows eight-fold hybrid enrichment at AsiSI breaks post-IR. In-vitro Lig4 ligation drops 50 % on hybrid substrates, reversible by RNaseH1; capture-seq reveals a two-fold rise in ≥5 bp microhomology joins.
