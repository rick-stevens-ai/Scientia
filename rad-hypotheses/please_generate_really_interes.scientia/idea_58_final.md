## Title

Phosphorylated FEN1 Binds R-Loops to Create Fragile Sites and Chromothripsis

## One Sentence Summary

IR-mimetic FEN1-S187E gains RNA-DNA hybrid affinity, incises both strands at clustered R-loops, triggering chromothriptic shattering.

## Paragraph Summary

EMSA KD ≈ 0.5 µM for S187E FEN1-R-loop. DRIP-ChIP shows >1000 co-occupied sites; nanopore sequencing reveals shattered segments in WT not catalytic-dead E160D cells.
