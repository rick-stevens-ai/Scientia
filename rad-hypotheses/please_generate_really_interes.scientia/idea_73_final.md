## Title

Nuclear FASN-Mediated Histone Palmitoylation Creates Lipid Microdomains that Recruit 53BP1

## One Sentence Summary

IR-phosphorylated FASN palmitoylates H2A/H2AX-K119, forming lipid patches that anchor 53BP1 and bias repair toward NHEJ.

## Paragraph Summary

Acyl-biotin exchange/MS confirms H2A-K119 palmitoylation 30 min post-4 Gy. TVB-2640 or FASN-S2221A mutants cut 53BP1 foci 40 % and increase HR, reducing indels.
