## Title

TRAF6-Mediated K63-Ubiquitination of XRCC4 Bridges Nuclear Repair Complex to TGF-β Receptor I, Driving EMT

## One Sentence Summary

Post-IR K63-Ub chains on XRCC4 expose an L45-like patch that binds TGF-βRI, triggering SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

## Paragraph Summary

Co-IP shows XRCC4-TGF-βRI complex forms within 1 h of IR but is lost in XRCC4-K210R mutant. SMAD-luciferase activity rises 3-fold, inducing Snail and Vimentin. Structural modelling predicts Ub-dependent conformational change enabling receptor interaction.
