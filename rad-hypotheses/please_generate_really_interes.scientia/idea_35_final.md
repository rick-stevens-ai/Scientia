# Final Report: Idea 35

## Title

DNA-Protein Crosslink (DPC) Neo-Antigens Drive IL-10-Rich Germinal Centres and Immunosuppressive IgG4 Responses

## One Sentence Summary

DPCs released from irradiated cells are presented by dendritic cells, skewing T-follicular helper cytokine milieu toward IL-10, promoting IgG4 class-switch and dampening anti-tumour immunity.

## Paragraph Summary

DPC immunisation elevates serum IgG4 by 5-fold in humanised mice. Single-cell RNA-seq of germinal centres shows IL-10high B-cells and Tfh-10 subset expansion. IgG4 competes with IgG1 for FcγRIIA on macrophages, reducing ADCC against irradiated tumour cells.
