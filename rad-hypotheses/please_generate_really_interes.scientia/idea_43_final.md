## Title

Checkpoint-Masking p53–YAP Condensates Fuel Early Oncogenic Transcription

## One Sentence Summary

Ionising radiation nucleates a p53–YAP liquid–liquid phase-separation condensate on γ-H2AX nanodomains, transiently excluding p53 co-repressors while amplifying YAP-TEAD pro-survival genes.

## Paragraph Summary

Building on recent LLPS work, we propose that clustered γ-H2AX creates a high-valency scaffold where lysine-rich p53 C-termini and YAP low-complexity regions co-assemble. The condensate physically blocks p300 and HDAC1 from binding p53, delaying cell-cycle arrest, yet retains TEAD-bound YAP to drive CTGF, CYR61 and AXL expression. Rapid dissolution (~2 h) restores checkpoints, creating a brief window that lets mis-repaired genomes proliferate.

## Key Ideas and Implementation

This section provides a detailed explanation of the key ideas and how they could be implemented or tested.

### Implementation and Testing Approach

1) In-vitro droplet assays with purified p53/YAP ± DNA; 2) live-cell FRAP of GFP-p53 & mCherry-YAP after 4 Gy; 3) hexanediol, p53(K→A) and YAP(ΔLCR) mutants to disrupt LLPS; 4) RNA-seq & ChIP-seq for YAP targets; 5) clonogenic survival in condensate-competent vs ‑deficient cells.
