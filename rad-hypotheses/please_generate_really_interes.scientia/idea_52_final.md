## Title

TERC RNA–DNA Hybrids Stall Ligase IV and Promote Microhomology-Mediated End Joining

## One Sentence Summary

ATM-phosphorylated TCAB1 escorts TERC to DSBs, where hybrids impede Lig4/XRCC4, biasing repairs toward mutagenic MMEJ.

## Paragraph Summary

DRIP-seq shows 8-fold hybrid enrichment at AsiSI breaks post-IR. Lig4 ligation on hybrid templates drops 50 %, reversible by RNaseH1. Capture-seq reveals 2-fold rise in ≥5-bp microhomology joins.
