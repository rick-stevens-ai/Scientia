**Title**: Silicon-Dominant Anodes to Boost Lithium Storage

**Key Idea**: Incorporating silicon as the primary anode material can dramatically increase the lithium storage capacity of EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Silicon anodes offer a theoretical capacity nearly ten times that of conventional graphite, but their practical application is limited by volumetric expansion and rapid degradation. Recent advances in nanostructuring and composite designs have shown promise in mitigating these effects, potentially unlocking much higher storage capacities. Successfully integrating silicon-dominant anodes could make a step-change improvement in EV battery performance.

**Approach**: Develop silicon nanowires or silicon-carbon composite anodes; assess electrochemical performance, cycle life, and mechanical integrity in prototype cells; scale for EV-relevant pouch cells.
