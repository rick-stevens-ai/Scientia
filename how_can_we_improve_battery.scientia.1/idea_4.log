**Title**: 3D Electrode Architectures for Enhanced Ion Transport

**Key Idea**: Implementing three-dimensional electrode architectures increases active material loading and improves ion transport, thus boosting storage capacity.

**Paragraph**: Traditional planar electrode designs restrict the amount of active material and limit ion diffusion, reducing practical capacity at high rates. 3D architectures, such as porous scaffolds or interdigitated structures, can increase surface area and facilitate shorter ion transport pathways, allowing for thicker electrodes without sacrificing rate capability. This architectural shift could significantly improve the practical storage capacity of EV batteries.

**Approach**: Design and fabricate 3D-structured electrodes using advanced fabrication (e.g., 3D printing, templating); measure capacity, rate performance, and mechanical stability in full-cell formats.
