**Title**: Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with Protected Lithium Anodes

**Key Idea**: Employing advanced protection strategies for lithium metal anodes in lithium-sulfur batteries can unlock ultra-high storage capacity for EVs.

**Paragraph**: Lithium-sulfur batteries have a theoretical energy density much higher than current lithium-ion technology, but practical implementation is hindered by lithium metal anode instability and polysulfide shuttle. Protective strategies such as artificial solid-electrolyte interphases or 3D hosts for lithium can suppress dendrite formation and side reactions, making lithium-sulfur batteries viable for high-capacity EV storage.

**Approach**: Develop and test lithium anode protection layers or structured hosts; build lithium-sulfur cells and assess capacity, cycling life, and safety under automotive-relevant conditions.
