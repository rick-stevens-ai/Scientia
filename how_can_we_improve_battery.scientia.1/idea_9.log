**Title**: Hybrid Supercapacitor-Battery Architectures for Enhanced Usable Capacity

**Key Idea**: Integrating supercapacitor elements with battery cells increases usable capacity by reducing stress and allowing deeper cycling.

**Paragraph**: Supercapacitors offer high power density and long cycle life, but lower energy density than batteries. Hybrid architectures that combine supercapacitor and battery electrodes can buffer high-power demands, reduce peak current loads on battery materials, and enable batteries to cycle deeper without rapid degradation, effectively increasing the usable storage capacity in EVs.

**Approach**: Design hybrid cells with asymmetric electrodes; test for energy/power density, cycle life, and depth-of-discharge tolerance; evaluate performance in drive-cycle simulations.
