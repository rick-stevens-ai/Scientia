**Title**: Thermal Management-Integrated Battery Design for Capacity Retention

**Key Idea**: Advanced thermal management integrated into battery packs preserves capacity and allows for higher-density cell stacking in EVs.

**Paragraph**: High storage capacity is often limited by thermal issues such as accelerated degradation and safety risks at elevated temperatures. Integrating phase-change materials, microfluidic cooling, or heat pipes directly into battery modules can maintain optimal temperatures, prevent hot spots, and support denser cell packaging, thus enabling higher total storage capacity without sacrificing longevity or safety.

**Approach**: Develop battery modules with embedded thermal management systems; test for temperature distribution, capacity retention, and pack-level energy density under simulated automotive loads.
