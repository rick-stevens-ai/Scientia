**Title**: Machine Learning Optimization of Electrode Compositions

**Key Idea**: Applying machine learning to optimize electrode formulations can discover new material combinations with maximized storage capacity.

**Paragraph**: The vast compositional space for battery electrodes makes empirical optimization slow and resource-intensive. Machine learning models can rapidly screen potential formulations and predict performance, accelerating the discovery of high-capacity electrode materials and combinations. This data-driven

**Approach**: could unveil unconventional but effective chemistries for EV batteries.  
**Approach**: Compile experimental databases of electrode formulations and performance metrics; develop and train ML models (e.g., random forests, neural networks); validate top predictions experimentally in prototype cells.
