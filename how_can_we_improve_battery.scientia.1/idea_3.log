**Title**: Solid-State Electrolytes for Compact, High-Capacity Batteries

**Key Idea**: Replacing liquid electrolytes with solid-state alternatives enables the use of high-capacity electrodes and increases overall battery storage in EVs.

**Paragraph**: Solid-state batteries allow the use of lithium metal anodes, which have the highest known specific capacity, while also improving safety and packing efficiency. Recent breakthroughs in sulfide and oxide solid electrolytes show promise for high ionic conductivity and manufacturability. Successfully integrating solid-state electrolytes could unlock higher energy densities, reduce battery footprint, and address safety concerns.

**Approach**: Fabricate prototype solid-state cells using lithium metal anodes and high-capacity cathodes; test for cycling stability, dendrite suppression, and energy density; conduct comparative performance analysis with liquid-electrolyte cells.
