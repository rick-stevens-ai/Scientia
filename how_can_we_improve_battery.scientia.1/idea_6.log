**Title**: Advanced Electrolyte Additives for Higher Voltage Operation

**Key Idea**: Introducing novel electrolyte additives stabilizes high-voltage cathodes, enabling increased battery storage capacity.

**Paragraph**: Pushing battery voltage higher directly increases energy density, but high-voltage cathodes often suffer from rapid degradation due to electrolyte breakdown. Advanced additives that form robust cathode-electrolyte interphases can significantly enhance stability and enable safe, long-term operation at higher voltages, thus improving storage capacity in EV batteries.

**Approach**: Screen and synthesize new electrolyte additives; test in coin and pouch cells with high-voltage cathodes (e.g., LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4); analyze performance, interphase chemistry, and cycling stability.
