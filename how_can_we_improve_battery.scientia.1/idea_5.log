**Title**: Dual-Ion Batteries for Higher Volumetric Capacity

**Key Idea**: Utilizing dual-ion battery chemistries enables storage of both cations and anions, enhancing total energy density for EV applications.

**Paragraph**: Dual-ion batteries (DIBs), where both the anion and cation participate in charge storage, can achieve higher operating voltages and potentially greater energy densities than traditional lithium-ion systems. Significant progress in developing stable, high-voltage electrolytes and compatible electrode materials could make DIBs a viable pathway for next-generation EV batteries with improved storage capacity.

**Approach**: Synthesize DIB cells with optimized electrode/electrolyte combinations; evaluate energy density, voltage window, and cycling stability under automotive conditions; benchmark against conventional lithium-ion cells.
