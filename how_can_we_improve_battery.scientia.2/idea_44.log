**Title**: Hybrid Li–S/Li-Ion Batteries with Advanced Selective Polysulfide Membranes, Shuttle Suppression, and Redox Mediator Integration

**Key Idea**: Combining highly selective polysulfide-blocking membranes, multi-pronged redox shuttle suppression, and beneficial redox mediator integration will boost energy density and cycle life in hybrid Li–S/Li-ion batteries for EVs.

**Paragraph**: Li–S batteries are plagued by polysulfide shuttling, causing rapid capacity fade. Integrating advanced separator membranes (graphene oxide, MXene, MOF-based films), redox shuttle suppressors, and, when beneficial, redox mediators that facilitate reversible conversion while impeding detrimental side reactions can effectively trap polysulfides and enhance reversibility [Manthiram et al. 2014; Li et al. 2019; Liang et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020]. This multi-pronged hybrid

**Approach**: enables high-capacity, long-lasting batteries suitable for EVs.

**Approach**: Fabricate hybrid batteries with advanced membranes, redox shuttle suppressors, and tunable redox mediators; use operando spectroscopy to track polysulfide dynamics and reversibility; test cycle stability in large-format cells.
