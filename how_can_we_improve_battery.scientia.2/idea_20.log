**Title**: Adaptive Multi-Scale Thermal Management for Maximized Usable EV Battery Capacity

**Key Idea**: Deploying adaptive, multi-scale thermal management systems with real-time sensing and control will further reduce thermal degradation and optimize usable storage capacity in EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: While advanced thermal management improves battery longevity, integrating multi-scale (cell, module, pack) solutions with AI-driven real-time sensing and control can more precisely maintain optimal conditions, minimize hotspots, and dynamically adapt to usage patterns [Pesaran 2002; Leng et al. 2021]. This

**Approach**: maximizes retained capacity and performance in diverse operational scenarios.

**Approach**: Develop battery packs with distributed thermal sensors, AI-based controllers, and multi-scale thermal interfaces (e.g., phase change, microfluidics); test under real-world and accelerated aging to quantify capacity retention gains.
