## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Electrolyte-Free, Solid-State Metal-Air Batteries with Reversible Oxygen Electrode Engineering for Ultra-High Energy Density

**Key Idea**: Developing electrolyte-free, all-solid-state metal-air batteries with engineered, reversible oxygen electrodes will realize ultra-high energy density and safety for future EVs.

**Paragraph**: Metal-air batteries (e.g., Li-air, Zn-air) promise energy densities far beyond Li-ion, but conventional designs are hampered by electrolyte volatility, dendrite growth, and irreversible oxygen chemistry. Removing the liquid electrolyte and engineering solid-state oxygen electrodes (e.g., via catalytically active, nanoporous, mixed-conductor materials) can enable safe, reversible oxygen reduction and evolution while preventing side reactions and dendrites [Bruce et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2021]. This could unlock practical metal-air batteries for EVs.

**Approach**: Synthesize all-solid-state metal-air cells with engineered oxygen electrodes; optimize catalyst composition, porosity, and conductivity; evaluate reversibility, safety, and energy density in prototype cells.
