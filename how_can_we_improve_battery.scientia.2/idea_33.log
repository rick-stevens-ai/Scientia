**Title**: Hierarchical Multi-Scale, AI-Driven Thermal Management with Predictive Control for EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Deploying hierarchical, multi-scale thermal management with AI-driven predictive control will maximize usable capacity and thermal safety in EV battery systems.

**Paragraph**: Battery longevity and performance are highly sensitive to thermal gradients and dynamic load. Integrating distributed micro/nanoscale sensors, real-time thermal mapping, and predictive AI-based control enables precise heat dissipation and preemptive hotspot mitigation across cell, module, and pack levels [Pesaran 2002; Leng et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2023]. Predictive control algorithms can adapt cooling strategies to forecasted driving and environmental conditions, further improving efficiency and safety.

**Approach**: Develop embedded sensor networks and AI controllers within battery packs; implement predictive algorithms for thermal management; validate thermal uniformity and capacity retention under aggressive and real-world profiles.
