**Title**: Modular, Swappable Micro-Pack Architectures for Flexible EV Battery Systems

**Key Idea**: Developing modular, swappable micro-pack battery architectures will enable flexible, user-customized energy storage and rapid servicing for EVs.

**Paragraph**: Traditional monolithic battery packs limit flexibility and increase downtime during maintenance or upgrades. By designing modular micro-packs—each with independent management and rapid-swapping capability—users can easily scale capacity, replace degraded modules, or adapt to varying driving needs [Ciez & Whitacre 2019; Choi & Aurbach 2016]. This architecture supports circular economy strategies and could accelerate EV adoption in diverse markets.

**Approach**: Engineer micro-pack modules with standardized interfaces and smart BMS; develop rapid-swapping hardware and software protocols; pilot in fleet and consumer EVs with lifecycle and user-experience studies.
