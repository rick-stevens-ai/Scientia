# Final Report: Idea 7

## Final ELO Score: 1516.2

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Interpretable Physics-Informed, Active-Learning ML with Automated Experimentation for Accelerated and Reliable Battery Material Discovery

**Key Idea**: Integrating interpretable, physics-informed machine learning with active learning, uncertainty quantification, and automated experimental feedback will expedite discovery and validation of next-generation battery materials.

**Paragraph**: Combining physics-informed ML with active learning and uncertainty quantification improves reliability and guides experimental validation, but full acceleration requires closing the loop with automated synthesis and characterization. Such a system can not only prioritize the most informative experiments but also autonomously execute and interpret them, creating a self-driving laboratory for battery discovery [Xie & Grossman 2018; Jha et al. 2019; Lookman et al. 2019; Stach et al. 2021]. This synergy is transformative for rapid breakthroughs in battery chemistries for EVs.

**Approach**: Develop interpretable ML models integrating physics-based features, active learning, and uncertainty quantification; connect to automated synthesis and high-throughput characterization platforms; use real-time feedback to iteratively refine models and accelerate discovery.

- Added [Stach et al. 2021] for autonomous experimentation.
