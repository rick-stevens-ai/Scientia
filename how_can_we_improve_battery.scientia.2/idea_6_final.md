## Final ELO Score: 1493.3

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Synergistic Multi-Additive Electrolytes and Adaptive, Self-Healing Composite Interphases for Dendrite-Free, High-Rate Lithium Metal Anodes

**Key Idea**: Synergistic multi-additive electrolytes and adaptive, self-healing composite interphases will ensure dendrite-free, high-rate lithium metal anodes and maximized safety in advanced EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Advanced electrolyte additives, including ionic liquids, fluorinated solvents, and boron-based compounds, can work together to form robust, flexible, and self-healing solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) that adapt to local stress and heal micro-defects. In situ formation of composite SEIs incorporating self-healing polymers and ceramic nanodomains further enhances mechanical and chemical protection, enabling stable cycling even at high rates and under abuse [Fan et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2021]. This comprehensive protection is vital for safe, high-capacity lithium metal EV batteries.

**Approach**: Systematically screen multi-additive and self-healing SEI formers; use multi-modal in situ characterization (XPS, cryo-TEM, AFM); validate in high-loading, high-rate full cells with real-time monitoring for dendrite initiation and healing.

- Incorporated high-rate operation and abuse resilience.
- Added [Chen et al. 2021] for self-healing polymer electrolytes.
