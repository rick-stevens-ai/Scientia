New Idea Generation (Round 2)
Generation Type: new

**Title**: Real-Time In Situ Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance for EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Integrating advanced in situ sensors and predictive maintenance algorithms will enable early detection of capacity loss and optimize battery replacement cycles in EVs.

**Paragraph**: Capacity loss in EV batteries is often detected only after significant degradation. Embedding in situ electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical sensors, combined with predictive analytics, allows real-time tracking of degradation pathways and early intervention [Li et al. 2020; Severson et al. 2019]. This capability extends usable battery life, prevents catastrophic failures, and reduces lifecycle costs.

**Approach**: Develop sensor-integrated battery packs, train predictive maintenance algorithms on real-world cycling data, and validate intervention strategies in fleet EV deployments.
