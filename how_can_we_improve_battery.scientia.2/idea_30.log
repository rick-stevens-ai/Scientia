**Title**: Interpretable Physics-Informed and Active-Learning ML for Accelerated Battery Material Discovery

**Key Idea**: Combining interpretable, physics-informed machine learning with active learning and uncertainty quantification will expedite battery material discovery while guiding experimental validation.

**Paragraph**: Physics-informed ML models, when combined with uncertainty quantification and active learning, can not only improve the reliability and interpretability of predictions but also prioritize the most informative experiments. This closed-loop

**Approach**: accelerates discovery and reduces resource consumption by focusing experimental efforts on the most promising, yet uncertain, candidates [Xie & Grossman 2018; Jha et al. 2019; Lookman et al. 2019]. Such synergy is vital for rapid progress in high-capacity battery chemistries for EVs.

**Approach**: Develop interpretable ML models integrating physics-based features; use active learning to iteratively select experiments; validate predictions in high-throughput synthesis and characterization workflows.
