**Title**: Multi-Phase, Tailored-Interface Solid-State Electrolytes with Dynamic Interphase Adaptation for Ultra-Safe, High-Performance EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Engineering multi-phase solid-state electrolytes with adaptive phase boundaries and dynamically responsive interfacial chemistries will simultaneously maximize ionic conductivity, mechanical robustness, and long-term interfacial stability for next-generation EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Multi-phase solid-state electrolytes, such as sulfide/oxide or polymer/ceramic composites, offer a path to overcoming the trade-off between ionic conductivity and mechanical integrity. However, static interfacial designs are susceptible to evolving degradation during cycling. By not only tailoring the chemical and structural properties at phase boundaries and interfaces but also incorporating dynamic or stimuli-responsive interphase chemistries (e.g., redox-active or ion-conducting adaptive layers), it becomes possible to continuously suppress interphase resistance, dendrite formation, and degradation—even under fluctuating loads and temperatures [Janek & Zeier 2016; Banerjee et al. 2020; Culver et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2021]. This strategy advances solid-state batteries closer to commercial viability with unprecedented safety and longevity.

**Approach**: Synthesize multi-phase composites with engineered and stimuli-responsive interfaces using atomic layer deposition, surface functionalization, or in situ polymerization; characterize interphase evolution under dynamic cycling using operando spectroscopy and electron microscopy; validate in full lithium-metal cells with aggressive cycling and abuse testing.

**Modifications**:  
- Extended to include dynamic/adaptive interphase chemistries, not just static tailored interfaces.
- Emphasized operando monitoring and adaptation under stress.
- Added [Wang et al. 2021] for dynamic solid-state interfaces.
