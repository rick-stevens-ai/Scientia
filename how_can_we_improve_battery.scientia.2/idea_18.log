**Title**: Hybrid Lithium-Sulfur/Lithium-Ion Batteries with Polysulfide-Blocking Membranes

**Key Idea**: Incorporating advanced polysulfide-blocking membranes and electrolyte additives in hybrid Li-S/Li-ion batteries will boost energy density and cycle stability for EVs.

**Paragraph**: The polysulfide shuttle effect remains a major challenge in Li-S batteries. Integrating selective separator membranes (e.g., functionalized carbon, 2D materials) and redox mediators as additives can trap polysulfides and facilitate their conversion, reducing loss and promoting long cycle life [Manthiram et al. 2014; Li et al. 2019]. This makes hybrid architectures more practical for high-capacity EV storage.

**Approach**: Fabricate hybrid cells with polysulfide-blocking membranes and redox-active electrolyte additives; monitor polysulfide migration and electrochemical performance over extended cycling.
