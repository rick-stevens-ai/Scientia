# Final Report: Idea 5

## Final ELO Score: 1501.9

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Dual-Ion Batteries with Hierarchically Graded Multi-Layered Interface Stabilization, Electrolyte Engineering, and Real-Time Impedance Sensing

**Key Idea**: Hierarchically graded, multi-layered interface stabilization, advanced electrolyte formulations, and real-time impedance sensing will extend the cycle life and capacity of dual-ion batteries for EVs.

**Paragraph**: Dual-ion batteries (DIBs) are limited by interface instability and side reactions, especially under high power. Hierarchically graded, multi-layered interphases (combining ion-selective, electronically insulating, and elastic layers) formed via sequential coating and in situ polymerization, together with high-voltage electrolyte additives, can suppress parasitic reactions. Embedding real-time impedance sensors allows early detection of interfacial failure and timely intervention, unlocking DIBs’ high-power, long-life potential for EVs [Lin et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2023; Li et al. 2022].

**Approach**: Develop multi-layered graded coatings for both electrodes; optimize electrolyte formulations; integrate impedance sensors for real-time monitoring; conduct accelerated lifecycle testing with data-driven feedback.
