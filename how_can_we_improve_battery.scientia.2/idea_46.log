**Title**: Hierarchical Multi-Scale, AI-Driven Thermal Management with Predictive Control and Adaptive Cooling Media for EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Deploying hierarchical, multi-scale thermal management with AI-driven predictive control and adaptive cooling media will maximize usable capacity, safety, and efficiency in EV battery systems.

**Paragraph**: Battery longevity and performance are highly sensitive to thermal gradients and dynamic load. Integrating distributed micro/nanoscale sensors, real-time thermal mapping, and predictive AI-based control enables precise heat dissipation and preemptive hotspot mitigation across all levels. Incorporating adaptive cooling media (e.g., phase change materials or tunable flow fluids) allows the system to dynamically match cooling intensity to predicted thermal loads [Pesaran 2002; Leng et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2023; Zhao et al. 2020]. Predictive control algorithms can adapt not just cooling strategies but also the cooling medium itself, further improving efficiency and safety.

**Approach**: Develop embedded sensor networks, adaptive cooling media, and AI controllers within battery packs; implement predictive algorithms for multi-modal thermal management; validate thermal uniformity, cooling efficiency, and capacity retention under aggressive and real-world operating profiles.
