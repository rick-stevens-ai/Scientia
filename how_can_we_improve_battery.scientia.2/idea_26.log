**Title**: Multi-Gradient Doping and Multifunctional Surface Coatings for Ultra-Stable High-Nickel Cathodes

**Key Idea**: Advanced multi-gradient doping strategies combined with multifunctional nanocoatings will dramatically improve the structural and interfacial stability of high-nickel cathodes for extended EV battery lifetimes.

**Paragraph**: Nickel-rich cathodes boost energy density but are limited by phase transitions, electrolyte attack, and microcracking. Applying tailored, multi-gradient doping (varying composition radially and axially) and multifunctional coatings (e.g., dual-layer oxide/polymer or ion-conductive ceramics) creates robust, self-passivating surfaces that mitigate degradation and thermal runaway [Li et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2020; Jung et al. 2017]. This

**Approach**: ensures high energy, long life, and safety for EV applications.

**Approach**: Synthesize NMC cathodes with spatially controlled gradient doping and apply multi-functional coatings using atomic layer or sol-gel methods; analyze degradation mechanisms under real-world cycling and temperature scenarios.
