**Title**: Electrochemical Self-Diagnosis and Autonomous Healing for Smart EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Embedding electrochemical self-diagnosis and autonomous healing functionalities within EV batteries will enable real-time fault detection and in situ repair, reducing maintenance and extending operational life.

**Paragraph**: Most batteries lack real-time insight into internal faults or the ability to self-repair. By integrating electrochemical sensors (for local potential, current, and impedance) and self-healing materials (e.g., microencapsulated healing agents, voltage-triggered polymerization), batteries can autonomously detect, localize, and mitigate faults such as microcracks or SEI breakdown [Li et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2023]. This technology reduces catastrophic failures, improves safety, and extends battery service life.

**Approach**: Integrate distributed micro-sensors and self-healing agents into cell architectures; develop algorithms for diagnosis and automated healing activation; validate in accelerated aging and abuse tests.

## Summary of Refinements
Each original idea has been strengthened by:
- **Extension** (e.g., multi-gradient or hierarchical structuring, bio-inspired materials),
- **Combination** (e.g., additive synergies, hybrid structures),
- **Addressing weaknesses** (e.g., interfacial instability, lack of real-time monitoring),
- **Addition of new, relevant citations**.

The three new ideas open frontiers in **bio-inspired chemistry**, **modular/swap architectures**, and **autonomous self-diagnosis/healing**, further broadening the innovation landscape for high-capacity, reliable EV batteries.
