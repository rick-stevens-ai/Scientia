### 2. Idea (ELO: 1508.9)

**Title**: Multi-Phase, Tailored-Interface Solid-State Electrolytes with Dynamic Interphase Adaptation for Ultra-Safe, High-Performance EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Engineering multi-phase solid-state electrolytes with adaptive phase boundaries and dynamically responsive interfacial chemistries will simultaneously maximize ionic conductivity, mechanical robustness, and long-term interfacial stability for next-generation EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Multi-phase solid-state electrolytes, such as sulfide/oxide or polymer/ceramic composites, offer a path to overcoming the trade-off between ionic conductivity and mechanical integrity. However, static interfacial designs are susceptible to evolving degradation during cycling. By not only tailoring the chemical and structural properties at phase boundaries and interfaces but also incorporating dynamic or stimuli-responsive interphase chemistries (e.g., redox-active or ion-conducting adaptive layers), it becomes possible to continuously suppress interphase resistance, dendrite formation, and degradation—even under fluctuating loads and temperatures [Janek & Zeier 2016; Banerjee et al. 2020; Culver et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2021]. This strategy advances solid-state batteries closer to commercial viability with unprecedented safety and longevity.

**Approach**: Synthesize multi-phase composites with engineered and stimuli-responsive interfaces using atomic layer deposition, surface functionalization, or in situ polymerization; characterize interphase evolution under dynamic cycling using operando spectroscopy and electron microscopy; validate in full lithium-metal cells with aggressive cycling and abuse testing.

**Key Idea**: Integrating hierarchically structured silicon-graphene anodes with autonomous self-healing binders, optimized conductive networks, and embedded stress sensors will enable maximal capacity, exceptional cycle life, and predictive maintenance in EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Silicon anodes suffer from severe volume changes and fracture, while graphene offers mechanical flexibility and high conductivity. Multi-level (nano-to-meso) architectures distribute stress and facilitate rapid ion/electron transport. By embedding autonomous, self-healing polymer binders and reinforcing the conductive network with carbon nanotubes or MXenes, the anode can self-repair and maintain performance.

**Title**: Integrated 3D Current Collectors and Multimodal Hierarchical Porosity with Automated Structural Rejuvenation for Ultra-Fast-Charging EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Integrating 3D-architectured current collectors with optimized multimodal hierarchical porosity and automated structural rejuvenation mechanisms will enable ultra-fast charging and exceptional longevity in EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: 3D current collectors and hierarchical (macro/meso/micro) porous electrodes minimize transport limitations and polarization, but repeated fast charging can cause pore collapse and loss of structural integrity. By incorporating materials or additives that enable reversible pore expansion/contraction or self-reorganization (e.g., via thermally responsive or electroactive polymers), electrodes can maintain optimal porosity and conductivity over thousands of cycles [Liu et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2021; Wu et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2022]. This innovation directly addresses the bottleneck for widespread, reliable ultra-fast charging.

**Approach**: Fabricate electrodes with multi-scale porosity, integrated 3D current collectors, and materials enabling structural rejuvenation; use 3D printing, templating, and in situ tomography to monitor and trigger pore restoration; validate under repeated ultra-fast charging in EV-relevant prototypes.

**Paragraph**: Most EV battery management strategies are agnostic to individual driving styles and environmental conditions. By embedding sensors and haptic actuators that provide real-time feedback (e.g., vibration alerts for aggressive driving or low battery), and by employing machine learning to adapt charging/discharging profiles to specific users, battery systems can optimize longevity, safety, and the driving experience [Birrell et al. 2016; Li et al. 2022]. This user-centric paradigm bridges human-computer interaction and battery science.

**Title**: Dual-Ion Batteries with Hierarchically Graded Multi-Layered Interface Stabilization, Electrolyte Engineering, and Real-Time Impedance Sensing

**Key Idea**: Hierarchically graded, multi-layered interface stabilization, advanced electrolyte formulations, and real-time impedance sensing will extend the cycle life and capacity of dual-ion batteries for EVs.
