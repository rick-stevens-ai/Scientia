**Title**: Synergistic Multi-Additive Electrolytes and Adaptive Self-Forming Interphases for Dendrite-Free Lithium Metal Anodes

**Key Idea**: Combining synergistic multi-additive electrolytes with adaptive, self-forming interphases will ensure dendrite-free lithium metal anodes and stable high-energy EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Advanced additive systems, including ionic liquids, fluorinated solvents, and boron-based compounds, work synergistically to form robust, flexible SEIs that adapt to local stress and heal defects. In situ formation of composite SEIs with polymer/ceramic components further enhances mechanical and chemical protection, enabling long-term cycling even under harsh conditions [Fan et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2020]. This comprehensive

**Approach**: is key to safe, high-capacity lithium metal EV batteries.

**Approach**: Systematically screen additive combinations and polymer/ceramic SEI formers; use multi-modal in situ characterization (XPS, cryo-TEM, AFM); validate in high-loading, high-rate full cells.
