**Title**: Multi-Phase, Tailored-Interface Solid-State Electrolytes for Ultra-Safe, High-Performance EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Designing multi-phase solid-state electrolytes with engineered phase boundaries and tailored interfacial chemistries will simultaneously maximize ionic conductivity, mechanical robustness, and interfacial stability for next-generation EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Multi-phase solid-state electrolytes (e.g., sulfide/oxide composites) offer a pathway to overcoming the persistent trade-off between ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. However, interfacial compatibility and phase boundary engineering remain bottlenecks for practical implementation. By deliberately tailoring the chemical and structural properties at phase boundaries and interfaces with electrodes, it is possible to suppress interphase resistance, dendrite formation, and interfacial degradation, pushing solid-state batteries closer to commercial viability [Janek & Zeier 2016; Banerjee et al. 2020; Culver et al. 2019]. This

**Approach**: enables safe, ultra-high-energy-density batteries with stable cycling.

**Approach**: Synthesize multi-phase composites with engineered interfaces using techniques such as atomic layer deposition or surface functionalization; systematically characterize phase boundaries, interfacial impedance, and mechanical properties; implement in full lithium-metal cells for rigorous safety and performance validation.

**Modifications**:  
- Extended from general multi-phase to specifically engineered phase boundaries and tailored interfaces.
- Addressed interfacial compatibility as a key limiter.
- Added new citation [Culver et al. 2019] for interface/microstructure design.
