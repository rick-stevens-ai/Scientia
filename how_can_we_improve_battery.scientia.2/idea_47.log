**Title**: Decentralized Blockchain-Based Battery Health and Lifecycle Tracking for EV Battery Ecosystems

**Key Idea**: Employing decentralized blockchain systems to securely track battery health, usage, and lifecycle events will enable transparent, tamper-proof management and circular economy solutions for EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: As EV batteries transition between manufacturers, users, and second-life applications, there is a critical need for secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant tracking of battery health and history. Blockchain technology can store immutable records of battery production, usage, health diagnostics, and recycling events, facilitating trust, optimizing second-life deployment, and supporting regulatory compliance [Wang et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2021]. Such digital passports will underpin next-generation battery value chains and circular economies.

**Approach**: Integrate distributed ledger technology into battery management systems; design protocols for secure, privacy-preserving data entry (from sensors, BMS, and service centers); pilot in multi-party EV battery lifecycle scenarios.
