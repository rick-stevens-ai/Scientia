**Title**: Human-Centric Battery Design: Adaptive Haptic Feedback and User-Behavior Learning for Personalized EV Battery Management

**Key Idea**: Integrating adaptive haptic feedback and user-behavior learning into EV battery systems will personalize battery management, maximizing safety, performance, and user satisfaction.

**Paragraph**: Most EV battery management strategies are agnostic to individual driving styles and environmental conditions. By embedding sensors and haptic actuators that provide real-time feedback (e.g., vibration alerts for aggressive driving or low battery), and by employing machine learning to adapt charging/discharging profiles to specific users, battery systems can optimize longevity, safety, and the driving experience [Birrell et al. 2016; Li et al. 2022]. This user-centric paradigm bridges human-computer interaction and battery science.

**Approach**: Develop integrated sensor-actuator systems and user-behavior analytics in BMS; implement adaptive feedback and personalized management algorithms; conduct user studies to optimize safety, performance, and satisfaction.
