**Title**: Multi-Scale, Conductive, and Self-Healing Silicon-Graphene Anodes with Real-Time Stress Sensing for Ultra-Long Cycle Life

**Key Idea**: Integrating hierarchically structured silicon-graphene anodes with autonomous self-healing binders, optimized conductive networks, and embedded stress sensors will enable maximal capacity, exceptional cycle life, and predictive maintenance in EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Silicon anodes suffer from severe volume changes and fracture, while graphene offers mechanical flexibility and high conductivity. Multi-level (nano-to-meso) architectures distribute stress and facilitate rapid ion/electron transport. By embedding autonomous, self-healing polymer binders and reinforcing the conductive network with carbon nanotubes or MXenes, the anode can self-repair and maintain performance. Furthermore, integrating stress- or strain-responsive conductive fillers (e.g., piezoresistive networks) enables real-time detection of mechanical degradation, allowing for predictive maintenance and further reliability [Zhang et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2021; Ding et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2021]. This synergy is crucial for commercial viability of high-capacity EV anodes.

**Approach**: Fabricate silicon-graphene composites with hierarchical structuring, self-healing polymers, optimized conductive additives, and embedded stress sensors; use in situ electron microscopy and strain mapping to monitor healing, network evolution, and stress accumulation; benchmark in full-cell EV prototypes with predictive analytics.
