**Title**: High-Voltage Spinel Cathodes Enabled by Hybrid Electrolyte Systems and Nano-Engineered Interfaces

**Key Idea**: Integration of high-voltage spinel cathodes with hybrid electrolyte formulations and nano-engineered cathode coatings will unlock higher specific energy and robust cycle stability for EVs.

**Paragraph**: Spinel cathodes like LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 are promising for high-voltage operation but are plagued by electrolyte oxidation and interface breakdown. Using hybrid electrolytes (mixtures of fluorinated, sulfone, and solid-state components) and nano-engineered, ultra-thin cathode coatings can suppress parasitic reactions and enhance interfacial resilience, dramatically extending battery lifespan [Kim et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2022; Nitta et al. 2019]. This

**Approach**: leverages both electrolyte and interface advances for superior EV performance.

**Approach**: Develop and test hybrid electrolytes and nano-coatings on spinel cathodes; use advanced spectroscopy and impedance analysis to probe stability under high voltage and fast cycling.
