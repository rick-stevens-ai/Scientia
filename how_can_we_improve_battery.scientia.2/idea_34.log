**Title**: Bio-Inspired Electrolyte Additives for Enhanced Battery Lifespan and Safety

**Key Idea**: Incorporating bio-inspired molecules as electrolyte additives can self-regulate ion transport and suppress side reactions, extending EV battery lifespan and safety.

**Paragraph**: Nature employs complex molecular architectures (e.g., ion channels, antifreeze proteins) to regulate ion flow and prevent aggregation. Translating these strategies, bio-inspired additives—such as peptide-based ion channels or antifreeze protein analogues—can selectively enhance lithium-ion transport while inhibiting dendritic or parasitic reactions [Wang et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2022]. This

**Approach**: offers a new paradigm for tuning electrolyte behavior, reducing degradation, and improving battery reliability.

**Approach**: Synthesize and characterize bio-inspired additives; evaluate effects on ionic conductivity, SEI formation, and cycling stability; conduct mechanistic studies and safety validation in prototype cells.
