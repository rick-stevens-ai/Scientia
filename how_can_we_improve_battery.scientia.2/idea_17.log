**Title**: Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Predictive Battery Material Discovery

**Key Idea**: Integrating physics-based descriptors and domain knowledge into machine learning models will enhance the predictive accuracy and interpretability for high-capacity battery material discovery.

**Paragraph**: While machine learning accelerates material discovery, incorporating physics-based constraints (e.g., thermodynamic stability, ionic migration barriers) significantly improves model reliability and interpretability [Xie & Grossman 2018; Jha et al. 2019]. This

**Approach**: yields more robust predictions and actionable insights for experimentalists, expediting the search for next-generation high-capacity battery chemistries.

**Approach**: Develop hybrid ML models that fuse data-driven features with physics-based descriptors, validate predictions experimentally, and iteratively refine models with new data from high-throughput screening.
