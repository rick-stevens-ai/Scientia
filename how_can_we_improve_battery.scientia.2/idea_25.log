**Title**: Hierarchical Silicon-Graphene Anodes with Autonomous Self-Healing and Conductive Network Optimization

**Key Idea**: Integrating hierarchically structured silicon-graphene anodes with autonomous self-healing polymers and optimized conductive networks will deliver maximal capacity and unprecedented cycle life for EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Silicon's high capacity is offset by severe volume changes and mechanical fracture, while graphene offers structural and conductivity advantages. Further gains are unlocked by constructing multi-level (nano-to-meso) architectures that distribute stress and facilitate fast ion/electron transport. By employing autonomous self-healing binders that dynamically repair cracks and reinforcing the conductive network with carbon nanotubes or MXenes, the anode can sustain repeated cycling with minimal capacity fade [Zhang et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2021; Ding et al. 2013]. This synergy is essential for commercial high-capacity EV anodes.

**Approach**: Fabricate silicon-graphene composites with hierarchical structuring and embedded self-healing, conductive additives; use in situ electron microscopy to monitor healing and network evolution; benchmark against conventional silicon anodes in full-cell EV prototypes.

**Modifications**:  
- Added conductive network optimization (e.g., carbon nanotubes, MXenes).
- Emphasized autonomous self-healing and multi-scale structure.
- New citation [Ding et al. 2013] for self-healing in silicon anodes.
