**Title**: Integrated 3D Current Collectors and Optimized Hierarchical Porosity for Ultra-Fast-Charging EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Integrating 3D-architectured current collectors with precisely engineered hierarchical porosity in electrodes will minimize transport limitations and enable extreme fast-charging in EVs.

**Paragraph**: 3D current collectors and electrodes improve ion/electron pathways, but combining them with hierarchical (macro/meso/micro) pore networks further reduces tortuosity and enhances electrolyte access, minimizing polarization during high-rate charging. Use of advanced 3D printing and templating enables fine control of electrode structure, while hybrid materials (e.g., metallic foams with carbon scaffolds) further boost performance [Liu et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2021; Wu et al. 2019]. This

**Approach**: addresses the critical bottleneck for widespread ultra-fast EV charging.

**Approach**: Employ 3D printing and soft/hard templating to fabricate electrodes with multi-scale porosity and integrated 3D current collectors; test under ultra-fast charging regimes and monitor structural stability via X-ray tomography.
