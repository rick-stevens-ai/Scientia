# Final Report: Idea 3

## Final ELO Score: 1498.2

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Multi-Gradient Doping and Dual-Functional, Self-Healing Nanocoatings for Ultra-Stable High-Nickel Cathodes

**Key Idea**: Advanced multi-gradient doping combined with dual-functional, self-healing nanocoatings will dramatically improve the structural, interfacial, and thermal stability of high-nickel cathodes for long-life, safe EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: Nickel-rich cathodes enable high energy density but are prone to phase transitions, electrolyte attack, and microcracking. Tailoring multi-gradient doping (radially and axially) and applying dual-functional nanocoatings (e.g., oxide/polymer or ion-conductive/elastic ceramics) creates robust, self-passivating, and self-healing surfaces that mitigate both electrochemical and mechanical degradation [Li et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2020; Jung et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2022]. Such coatings can autonomously repair minor cracks or defects, further suppressing degradation and thermal runaway, and ensuring safety and longevity.

**Approach**: Synthesize NMC cathodes with spatially controlled gradient doping; apply dual-functional, self-healing nanocoatings via atomic layer deposition or in situ polymerization; monitor degradation and healing via in situ microscopy and spectroscopy under real-world cycling and abuse scenarios.
