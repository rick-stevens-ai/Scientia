**Title**: High-Voltage Spinel Cathodes with Compatible Electrolyte and Interfacial Stabilization

**Key Idea**: Pairing high-voltage spinel cathodes with engineered high-voltage electrolytes and interfacial coatings will enable greater specific energy and cycle stability in EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: High-voltage spinel cathodes (e.g., LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4) promise higher energy, but are limited by electrolyte oxidation and interface degradation. Developing fluorinated and sulfone-based electrolytes, along with robust cathode coatings, can mitigate these issues, extend cycle life, and unlock the full potential of spinel cathodes for EVs [Kim et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2022].

**Approach**: Synthesize spinel cathodes, pair with high-voltage-tolerant electrolytes and nanocoatings, and assess electrochemical and interfacial stability under accelerated cycling.
