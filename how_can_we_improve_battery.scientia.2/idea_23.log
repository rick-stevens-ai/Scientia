**Title**: Bipolar Battery Architectures for Ultra-High Energy Density EV Packs

**Key Idea**: Implementing bipolar electrode designs in EV battery packs can dramatically increase volumetric energy density and reduce internal resistance, enabling longer driving ranges.

**Paragraph**: Conventional battery packs rely on tab-connected cells, which introduce significant dead volume and resistance. Bipolar architectures stack cells with shared current collectors, minimizing interconnects and maximizing active material per unit volume [Tarascon & Armand 2001; Li et al. 2021]. This

**Approach**: can significantly boost the total energy stored within a given pack size, critical for next-generation high-capacity EVs.

**Approach**: Design and prototype bipolar battery modules using advanced materials (e.g., solid-state, lithium-ion, or lithium-sulfur chemistries), evaluate mechanical, electrical, and safety performance, and compare against traditional pack architectures.
