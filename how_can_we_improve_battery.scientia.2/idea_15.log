**Title**: Dual-Ion Batteries with Advanced Electrode Stabilization for Long Cycle Life

**Key Idea**: Implementing advanced surface stabilization strategies in dual-ion batteries will enable higher reversible capacity and extend cycle life for EV applications.

**Paragraph**: Dual-ion batteries (DIBs) offer the prospect of higher voltage and energy density, but suffer from electrode degradation and electrolyte decomposition. Surface functionalization and protective coatings for both anode and cathode can stabilize electrode-electrolyte interfaces, reducing capacity fade while preserving high energy density [Lin et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2020]. This makes DIBs more competitive as a practical EV battery technology.

**Approach**: Synthesize and test surface-stabilized electrode materials in DIB configurations, monitor interface evolution with advanced spectroscopy, and cycle under EV-relevant load profiles.
