**Title**: Synergistic Additive Systems and Dynamic Interphases for Dendrite-Free Lithium Metal Anodes

**Key Idea**: Employing synergistic combinations of electrolyte additives and dynamically adaptive interphases will suppress dendrite growth and enable safe, high-capacity lithium metal batteries.

**Paragraph**: Single additives can mitigate dendrite formation, but combining multiple additives (e.g., LiNO3 with fluorinated solvents and boron compounds) can create a dynamic, self-repairing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that responds to cycling stress and prevents dendrite propagation [Fan et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2022]. This strategy significantly improves the reliability and energy density of lithium metal batteries for EVs.

**Approach**: Screen additive combinations for synergistic effects on SEI formation and dendrite suppression, use in situ microscopy and spectroscopy to observe interphase dynamics during cycling, and validate in pouch cells under aggressive cycling.
