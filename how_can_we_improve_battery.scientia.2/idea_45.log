**Title**: High-Voltage Spinel Cathodes with Hybrid Electrolyte Systems, Nano-Engineered Interfaces, and Embedded Overcharge Protection

**Key Idea**: Integrating high-voltage spinel cathodes with hybrid electrolyte formulations, nano-engineered cathode coatings, and embedded overcharge protection will unlock higher specific energy, robust cycle stability, and improved safety for EVs.

**Paragraph**: Spinel cathodes such as LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 are promising for high-voltage operation but are limited by electrolyte oxidation, interface breakdown, and overcharge risks. Hybrid electrolytes (fluorinated, sulfone, and solid-state mixtures), nano-engineered ultra-thin coatings, and embedded overcharge-protection additives (e.g., redox shuttles or voltage-sensitive polymers) can suppress parasitic reactions and mitigate dangerous overcharging events [Kim et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2022; Nitta et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2021]. These advances offer superior energy, longevity, and safety for EVs.

**Approach**: Develop and test hybrid electrolytes, nano-coatings, and overcharge-protection systems on spinel cathodes; use spectroscopy and impedance analysis to probe stability and safety under high voltage and fast cycling.
