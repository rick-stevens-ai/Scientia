**Title**: All-Solid-State Sodium-Ion Batteries for Cost-Effective High-Capacity EV Storage

**Key Idea**: Developing all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries with advanced solid electrolytes will provide a safe, high-capacity, and cost-effective alternative for large-scale EV deployment.

**Paragraph**: While lithium-based batteries dominate EVs, sodium-ion batteries offer significant cost and resource advantages due to sodium’s abundance. Combining sodium-ion chemistry with solid-state electrolytes can overcome safety and energy density limitations of traditional sodium batteries, making them a compelling option for affordable, scalable EVs [Pan et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2022]. Advances in solid electrolytes and compatible electrode materials are key to unlocking this potential.

**Approach**: Synthesize novel solid-state electrolytes and compatible sodium-ion electrodes, integrate into full cells, and benchmark performance (capacity, safety, cost) against lithium-based solid-state EV batteries.
