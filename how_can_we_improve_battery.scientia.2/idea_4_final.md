## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Integrated 3D Current Collectors and Multimodal Hierarchical Porosity with Automated Structural Rejuvenation for Ultra-Fast-Charging EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Integrating 3D-architectured current collectors with optimized multimodal hierarchical porosity and automated structural rejuvenation mechanisms will enable ultra-fast charging and exceptional longevity in EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: 3D current collectors and hierarchical (macro/meso/micro) porous electrodes minimize transport limitations and polarization, but repeated fast charging can cause pore collapse and loss of structural integrity. By incorporating materials or additives that enable reversible pore expansion/contraction or self-reorganization (e.g., via thermally responsive or electroactive polymers), electrodes can maintain optimal porosity and conductivity over thousands of cycles [Liu et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2021; Wu et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2022]. This innovation directly addresses the bottleneck for widespread, reliable ultra-fast charging.

**Approach**: Fabricate electrodes with multi-scale porosity, integrated 3D current collectors, and materials enabling structural rejuvenation; use 3D printing, templating, and in situ tomography to monitor and trigger pore restoration; validate under repeated ultra-fast charging in EV-relevant prototypes.
