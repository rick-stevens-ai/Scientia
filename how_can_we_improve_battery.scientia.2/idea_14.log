**Title**: 3D Current Collector Integration and Pore-Engineered Electrodes for Fast-Charging EV Batteries

**Key Idea**: Combining 3D-architectured electrodes with optimized current collectors and pore-engineered scaffolds will further improve ion transport and charge/discharge rates in EV batteries.

**Paragraph**: While 3D electrodes enhance active material usage and ion transport, integrating 3D current collectors (e.g., conductive foams or lattices) and tailoring pore size distributions can dramatically reduce resistance and enable ultra-fast charging [Liu et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2021]. This

**Approach**: addresses bottlenecks in high-rate performance and paves the way for next-generation fast-charging batteries.

**Approach**: Fabricate electrodes with 3D current collectors and controlled pore architectures using advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing, freeze casting); benchmark against 2D and traditional 3D electrodes under high-rate cycling.
