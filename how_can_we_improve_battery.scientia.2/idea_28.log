**Title**: Dual-Ion Batteries with Multi-Layered Interface Stabilization and Electrolyte Engineering

**Key Idea**: Multi-layered interface stabilization and advanced electrolyte formulations will extend dual-ion battery cycle life and capacity for demanding EV applications.

**Paragraph**: Dual-ion batteries (DIBs) are hampered by electrode/electrolyte interface instability and side reactions. Multi-layered, ion-selective interphases—formed via sequential coating and in situ polymerization—alongside high-voltage electrolyte additives, can suppress parasitic reactions and preserve high capacity over thousands of cycles [Lin et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2023]. These advances unlock DIBs’ promise for high-power, long-life EV batteries.

**Approach**: Develop and apply multi-layered protective coatings (e.g., polymer/ceramic) to both electrodes; optimize electrolyte with functional additives; conduct accelerated lifecycle and safety testing.
