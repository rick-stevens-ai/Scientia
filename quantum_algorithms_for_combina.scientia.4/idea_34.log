**Title**: Post-Quantum Secure Key Exchange with Quantum-Resistant Algorithms

**Key Idea**: A post-quantum secure key exchange protocol can be developed using quantum-resistant algorithms to protect against quantum attacks.

**Paragraph**: Current key exchange protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange, are vulnerable to quantum attacks. A post-quantum secure key exchange protocol can be developed by leveraging quantum-resistant algorithms, such as lattice-based cryptography and code-based cryptography [Micciancio 2001]. This idea explores a novel angle by applying quantum-resistant algorithms to key exchange protocols.

**Approach**: Develop a post-quantum secure key exchange protocol that leverages quantum-resistant algorithms. Implement advanced quantum error correction techniques to improve the accuracy of the protocol.
