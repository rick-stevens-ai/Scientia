**Title**: Post-Quantum Cryptography with Lattice-Based Cryptography

**Key Idea**: Lattice-based cryptography can be used to develop post-quantum cryptographic protocols.

**Paragraph**: Current cryptographic protocols, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography, are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Lattice-based cryptography, which relies on the hardness of problems in lattice theory, can be used to develop post-quantum cryptographic protocols [Micciancio 2001]. This idea explores a novel angle by applying lattice-based cryptography to develop post-quantum cryptographic protocols.

**Approach**: Develop a lattice-based cryptographic protocol that leverages the hardness of problems in lattice theory to provide post-quantum security.
