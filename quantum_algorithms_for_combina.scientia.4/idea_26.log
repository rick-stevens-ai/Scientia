**Title**: Quantum-Inspired Optimization for Cryptographic Protocols

**Key Idea**: Quantum-inspired optimization techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of cryptographic protocols.

**Paragraph**: Cryptographic protocols, such as key exchange and digital signatures, rely on complex mathematical problems for security. Quantum-inspired optimization techniques, such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), can be used to improve the efficiency of these protocols [Farhi et al. 2014]. This idea explores a novel angle by applying quantum-inspired techniques to classical cryptographic protocols.

**Approach**: Develop a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm that leverages quantum parallelism and interference to improve the efficiency of cryptographic protocols.
