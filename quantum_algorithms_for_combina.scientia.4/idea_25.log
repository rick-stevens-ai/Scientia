**Title**: Quantum Computing for Elliptic Curve Cryptography

**Key Idea**: A quantum algorithm can be developed to break elliptic curve cryptography more efficiently than classical algorithms.

**Paragraph**: Elliptic curve cryptography is a widely used cryptographic protocol, but it is vulnerable to quantum attacks. A quantum algorithm leveraging quantum parallelism and interference could potentially break elliptic curve cryptography more efficiently [Childs et al. 2017]. To strengthen this idea, we can combine quantum algorithms with machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of the attack [Wiebe et al. 2015].

**Approach**: Develop a quantum circuit that utilizes quantum parallelism to search for solutions to elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems. Implement a variant of the quantum algorithm for linear algebra [Childs et al. 2017].
