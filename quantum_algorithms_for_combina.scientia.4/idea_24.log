**Title**: Quantum Algorithm for the Shortest Vector Problem

**Key Idea**: A quantum algorithm can be developed to solve the shortest vector problem (SVP) more efficiently than classical algorithms.

**Paragraph**: The SVP is a fundamental problem in number theory and cryptography, and solving it has applications in lattice-based cryptography. Current classical algorithms have limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability. A quantum algorithm leveraging quantum parallelism and interference could potentially solve SVP more efficiently [Micciancio 2001]. To refine this idea, we can extend the algorithm to solve more general lattice problems, such as the closest vector problem (CVP) [Goldreich et al. 1999].

**Approach**: Develop a quantum circuit that utilizes quantum parallelism to search for the shortest vector in a lattice. Implement a variant of the quantum algorithm for linear algebra [Childs et al. 2017].
