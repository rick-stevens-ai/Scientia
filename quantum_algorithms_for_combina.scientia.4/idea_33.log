**Title**: Quantum-Secure Multi-Party Computation

**Key Idea**: A quantum-secure multi-party computation protocol can be developed to enable secure computation among multiple parties while protecting against quantum attacks.

**Paragraph**: Multi-party computation is a fundamental problem in cryptography, and current classical protocols have limitations in terms of security and scalability. A quantum-secure multi-party computation protocol can be developed by leveraging quantum key distribution and quantum-secure computation techniques [Bennett et al. 1984]. This idea explores a novel angle by applying quantum-secure techniques to multi-party computation.

**Approach**: Develop a quantum-secure multi-party computation protocol that leverages quantum key distribution and quantum-secure computation techniques. Implement advanced quantum error correction techniques to improve the accuracy of the protocol.
