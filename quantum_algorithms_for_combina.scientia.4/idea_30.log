**Title**: Enhancing Quantum Factoring with Machine Learning

**Key Idea**: Machine learning techniques can be used to enhance the efficiency of quantum factoring algorithms by improving the robustness and efficiency of quantum error correction.

**Paragraph**: Quantum factoring algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm, have the potential to factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical algorithms. However, noise and error correction remain significant challenges. Machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, can be used to improve the robustness and efficiency of quantum factoring algorithms [Wiebe et al. 2015]. By combining machine learning with advanced quantum error correction techniques, we can further enhance the efficiency of quantum factoring [Bennett et al. 2012].

**Approach**: Develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that leverages machine learning techniques to enhance the efficiency and robustness of quantum factoring algorithms. Implement advanced quantum error correction techniques to improve the accuracy of the algorithm.
