**Title**: Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Prime Number Generation

**Key Idea**: A quantum algorithm can be developed to generate large prime numbers exponentially faster than classical algorithms.

**Paragraph**: Prime numbers play a crucial role in number theory, and their generation has numerous applications in cryptography. Current classical algorithms for prime number generation, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, have limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability. A quantum algorithm leveraging quantum parallelism and interference could potentially generate large prime numbers more efficiently [Shor 1994]. To strengthen this idea, we can combine quantum parallelism with machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of prime number generation [Wiebe et al. 2015].

**Approach**: Develop a quantum circuit that utilizes quantum parallelism to search for prime numbers within a given range. Implement Shor's algorithm [Shor 1994] or a variant to factorize numbers and identify prime numbers. Additionally, integrate machine learning techniques to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm.
