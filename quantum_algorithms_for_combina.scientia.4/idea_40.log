**Title**: Quantum-Secure Multi-Party Computation with Homomorphic Encryption

**Key Idea**: A quantum-secure multi-party computation protocol can be developed to enable secure computation among multiple parties while protecting against quantum attacks using homomorphic encryption.

**Paragraph**: Multi-party computation is a fundamental problem in cryptography, and current classical protocols have limitations in terms of security and scalability. A quantum-secure multi-party computation protocol can be developed by leveraging quantum key distribution and quantum-secure computation techniques [Bennett et al. 1984]. By using homomorphic encryption [Gentry et al. 2009], we can enable secure computation on encrypted data.

**Approach**: Develop a quantum-secure multi-party computation protocol that leverages quantum key distribution and homomorphic encryption. Implement advanced quantum error correction techniques to improve the accuracy of the protocol.
