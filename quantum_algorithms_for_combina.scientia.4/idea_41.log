**Title**: Post-Quantum Secure Key Exchange with Quantum-Resistant Algorithms and Machine Learning

**Key Idea**: A post-quantum secure key exchange protocol can be developed using quantum-resistant algorithms and machine learning techniques to protect against quantum attacks.

**Paragraph**: Current key exchange protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange, are vulnerable to quantum attacks. A post-quantum secure key exchange protocol can be developed by leveraging quantum-resistant algorithms, such as lattice-based cryptography and code-based cryptography [Micciancio 2001]. By combining these algorithms with machine learning techniques, we can improve the efficiency and security of the protocol.

**Approach**: Develop a post-quantum secure key exchange protocol that leverages quantum-resistant algorithms and machine learning techniques. Implement advanced quantum error correction techniques to improve the accuracy of the protocol.
