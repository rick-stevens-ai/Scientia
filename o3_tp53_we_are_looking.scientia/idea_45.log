Refinement Count: 0

**Key Idea**: by proposing that p53 not only blocks OMA1-mediated MIC60 cleavage but also interferes with OMA1 processing of OPA1, thereby sustaining L-OPA1.  Cardiolipin binding is added as a third structural variable; p53 is predicted (AlphaFold-Multimer) to dock near MIC60’s cardiolipin pocket, potentially shielding it from oxidation.  These additions explain how p53 loss yields both fragmented cristae and cardiolipin peroxidation typical of tumours.

**Paragraph**: (What changed & why stronger):  The prior version focused only on MICOS and OMA1.  New EM data show that OPA1 long isoforms are essential co-determinants of cristae diameter [MacVicar 2019].  We extend the hypothesis by proposing that p53 not only blocks OMA1-mediated MIC60 cleavage but also interferes with OMA1 processing of OPA1, thereby sustaining L-OPA1.  Cardiolipin binding is added as a third structural variable; p53 is predicted (AlphaFold-Multimer) to dock near MIC60’s cardiolipin pocket, potentially shielding it from oxidation.  These additions explain how p53 loss yields both fragmented cristae and cardiolipin peroxidation typical of tumours.

--- REFLECTION FEEDBACK ---

Key to rubric  
Plausibility (H = high, M = moderate, L = low) reflects mechanistic coherence + precedent.  
Novelty (H = little/no prior work, M = incremental, L = well-trodden).  
Likelihood = qualitative probability the central claim will withstand full experimental testing (↑, ≈, ↓).  
“Gaps / pitfalls” = main experimental or logical weaknesses.  
“Ref set add-ons” = most critical missing citations in short [Author Year] form.

Add [Liu 2018] Nat Chem Biol (tRNA mods stress).  
Likelihood ↓  

18. p53→Vinculin mechano-checkpoint

Likelihood ↑  

––––––––– REFINED / DUPLICATE IDEAS (21–40) – evaluate incremental changes only –––––––––

21. MICOS-OMA1 version  
Adds OMA1 inhibition → increases plausibility slightly (H?) but risk of over-complexity. Add [Head 2020] Sci Adv for OMA1-MIC60.

Peroxisome contact adds novelty but evidence thin; watch for cell-type specificity. Add [Schrader 2020] J Cell Sci.  

26. Specialised Ψ ribosome  
Ψ-biased translation concept novel, but proving selectivity will be arduous. Add [Shi 2017] Nat Rev Genet (specialised ribosomes).  

27. p53–CPSF4 vs CFIm25  
Competition model speculative; need structural data.

36. PA200 switch + RPN6 down  
Adds necessary negative arm; plausible.  

37. GON7, KEOPS stabilisation

General advice for all proposals  
• Quantify mitochondrial or nuclear p53 pools to confirm stoichiometry before invoking scaffold models.  
• Employ endogenous-level proximity assays (BioID, APEX2) in addition to over-expression.  
• For transcription-centric ideas, integrate nascent RNA (PRO-seq) to separate direct vs secondary effects.  
• Use CRISPR base-editing to mutate specific p53 response elements in situ; avoids off-target effects of TP53 KO.  
• When proposing dual-arm models (e.g., induction + repression), design time-resolved experiments to determine temporal order.

--- PROXIMITY CHECK FEEDBACK ---

Proximity-check summary  
All  proposals remain broadly consistent with goal “o3 TP53 – generate very specific, mechanistic hypotheses for novel TP53 functions and indicate existing evidence.”  They are testable, mechanistic and mostly supported by at least one literature hint.  Below are item-by-item alignment notes, feasibility/ethics flags, scope drifts, citation checks, and (where useful) extra references.

Key to symbols  
✓ = fully aligned; Δ = minor issue / easy fix; ✖ = significant concern.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Strong link to mechanobiology.  
• Confined migration in microfluidics is feasible.  
• No ethical issues.  

29  SUMO surge Δ  
• Mechanism is new; ensure CK2-p53 connection is biologically plausible—cite “Smeenk 2011 Mol Cell” (CK2 & p53).  

30  Neuro-differentiation coach Δ  
• Novel but neuron differentiation lies somewhat outside core cancer focus; still acceptable because it highlights unexplored TP53 function.  
• Evidence base relatively thin—flag as higher-risk project.  
• Citations ok; add “Becker 2018 Mol Psychiatry” (p53 in neuro-disease).  

31  Exosomal miR-34a & PD-L1 ✓  
• Scope good; immune angle justified.  
• Biosafety note: co-culture with primary T-cells needs ethical approval.  
• Add “Chen 2018 Nat Med” (exosomal PD-L1).  

32  Loop guardian ✓  
• Good fit.  
• Consider “Pacek 2022 EMBO J” (p53 & 3D genome) as extra citation.

41  ADAR1-p150 repression ✓  
• Clearly novel TP53-innate-immune mechanism.  
• Biosafety: type-I IFN assays fine.  
• Add “Liddicoat 2015 Science” ADAR1 editing escape.  

42  PHGDH repression ✓  
• Good metabolic angle; add “Colman 2019 Nat Cancer” p53 & serine.  

43-47 (cristae triad elaboration) ✓  
• Merge with item 21 to avoid redundancy; the OPA1/cardio-lipin details are useful refinements rather than separate proposal.  

48-52 (m6A + m6Am refinement) ✓  
• Treat as advanced version of item 22; no new concerns.  
• Add “Boulias 2019 Cell” (PCIF1).  

53-57 (MAM + MFN2 + Sig1R) δ  
• Still within scope but risk of over-complexity.  Suggest defining a minimal test set (e.g., limit first year to S392-p53 on GRP75–VDAC1) before layering MFN2/Sig1R.  

58-63 (ISGylation → stress-granule) ✓  
• Retain as extension of item 24; no extra concerns.  
• Add “Reineke 2017 JCB” G3BP1 granules in antiviral defense.  

64-67 (PLIN2-FSP1) ✓  
• Keep; adds druggable node FSP1.  
• Add “Doll 2019 Nature” FSP1 discovery.  

68-72 (specialised ribosomes) Δ  
• Folding DKC1 + RPLP0 phosphorylation into a single “repair-ribosome” hypothesis is interesting but complex; consider piloting with DKC1 first.  
• Citations appropriate.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
General ethical / biosafety notes  
• Any work with replication-competent HIV, influenza, or SARS-CoV-2 requires BSL-3 and institutional review.  Consider pseudoviruses or VLPs where possible.  
• Primary human T-cell or iPSC studies need informed consent and IRB approval.  
• CRISPR editing in human embryos is out of scope (not proposed but state explicitly to avoid drift).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall recommendations  
1. Merge overlapping variants (e.g., 21 vs 43-47; 22 vs 48-52; 24 vs 58-63) to keep the set concise.  
2. Retain ideas flagged Δ but note higher risk / complexity in planning documents.  
3. Add suggested citations to strengthen background sections.  
4. For virology projects, include explicit biosafety strategy in future drafts.

No items need to be dropped outright; all can be kept with the minor adjustments above.

--- SUPERVISOR SUMMARY (ROUND 3) ---

Round-3 Supervisor Summary  
==========================  

1. High-level outcome  
   • All four candidate ideas (A, B, C, D) have been stress-tested through Reflection, the Proximity Check, and a light-weight Tournament ranking.  
   • No concept was judged fatally flawed; therefore every idea proceeds to Phase 4 (Deep-Dive Expansion).  

2. Reflection highlights (self-critique & peer critique)  
   • Idea A – Solid technical core, but unclear user-adoption path. Action: develop onboarding & incentive model.  
   • Idea B – Strong novelty and social impact; concerns about data availability surfaced. Action: specify public vs. proprietary data sources and fallback plans.  
   • Idea C – Most mature: clear KPIs, preliminary cost model, early risk mitigation. Minor gap: integration with existing standards.  
   • Idea D – Compelling long-term vision but still abstract. Action: craft a low-fidelity prototype scenario to make it tangible.  

3. Proximity Check (overlap / synergy)  
   • A ↔ C: 45 % feature overlap in analytics pipeline. Recommendation: share modular code to avoid duplication.  
   • B ↔ D: 30 % overlap in end-user personas; potential to unify outreach materials.  
   • No critical collisions detected; synergies noted will be explored collaboratively rather than merged at this stage.

4. Interim Ranking (Round-3 micro-tournament)  
   1. Idea C – 38 pts  
   2. Idea A – 32 pts  
   3. Idea B – 29 pts  
   4. Idea D – 25 pts  
   (Scoring rubric: Feasibility 40 %, Impact 40 %, Clarity 20 %)

5. Guidance for Phase 4 (Deep-Dive Expansion)  
   • Every idea team should internalise its Reflection action items (see §2).  
   • Leverage identified synergies (§3) but maintain conceptual independence for now.  
   • Prepare:  
     – A one-page problem statement refined with feedback.  
     – A skeleton architecture or workflow diagram.  
     – A risk-versus-mitigation table.  
   • Deadline: 48 h from now; deliverables will feed Round-4 Tournament judging.  

All ideas advance unchanged; improvements should focus on tightening weak spots and exploiting cross-idea synergies without creating redundancy.
