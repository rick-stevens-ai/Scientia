**Title**: Non-Canonical Proteasome Switch—TP53 Induction of PA200 to Drive Ubiquitin-Independent Degradation

**Key Idea**: Under metabolic stress, TP53 up-regulates the 20S proteasome activator PSME4 (PA200), enhancing acetylated-histone clearance for amino-acid recycling.

**Paragraph**: PA200 caps 20S core, degrading acetylated histones during spermatogenesis and DNA repair [Qian 2013]. RNA-seq after p53 activation shows PSME4 up 2-fold (GSE62944). We hypothesize p53 expands ubiquitin-independent proteolysis to supply amino acids under starvation.

**Approach**: 1) ChIP-qPCR on PSME4 promoter. 2) Measure 20S gate opening with activity probes. 3) Track histone acetyl peptide turnover via pulse-SILAC. 4) Assess cell survival in amino-acid-free media ± PA200 knockdown.

**Key References**: Qian 2013 (Nat Struct Mol Biol, PA200 proteasome); Mandemaker 2018 (Front Mol Biosci, ubiquitin-independent degradation).

Idea 17

--- REFLECTION FEEDBACK ---

Structured critique of each hypothesis (≈350–400 words each; feel free to condense where space is tight). Legend: ★★★★ = strong, ★★ = moderate, ★ = weak.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Mitochondrial Cristae Architect—TP53/MICOS
Plausibility ★★½  
• p53 is reported in mitochondria and can bind Bcl-2–family proteins, but no precedent for interaction with membrane-shaping complexes.  
• MIC60–MIC19 interaction is essential for crista junction width; a scaffold role by a DNA-binding protein is mechanistically reasonable but unproven.

Novelty ★★★★  
No prior literature proposes p53 as an organizer of cristae.

Potential flaws / confounders  
• Co-IP from BioPlex may reflect indirect association through TOM complex.  
• Cristae changes may arise secondarily from altered transcription of OXPHOS genes by p53.  
• Need to exclude transcriptional effects on MICOS subunits themselves.

Likelihood ≈30 %.  

Citation assessment  
Giorgi 2015 review is broad; add mechanistic primary papers on mitochondrial p53 localization ([Vaseva 2012], [Giorgi 2010]) and MICOS structure ([Friedman 2015], [Rampelt 2017]).  

Suggestions  
• Include actinonin rescue of MIC60 to decouple structural vs transcriptional effects.  
• Use p53 tetramerization-deficient mutant to see whether oligomeric status matters for scaffolding.

────────────────────────────────────────
2. Guardian of the Epitranscriptome—TP53/FTO
Plausibility ★★★  
p53 is a transcriptional repressor in some contexts (e.g., CDC25C). FTO regulation by stress has been shown in adipocytes; ChIP peaks supportive.

Novelty ★★★  
p53–m6A axis largely unexplored.

Weaknesses  
• FTO also acts in the nucleus on snRNAs; global m6A rise may have deleterious side-effects.  
• p53 binding may be cell-type-specific; need multiple lines.

Likelihood ≈45 %.  

Citations  
Su 2020 is strong; add [Chen 2019] for FTO in stress and [Zaccara 2019] for m6A writers/erasers.  

Improvements  
• Test whether p53 recruits polycomb to FTO enhancer (matches H3K27me3 claim).  
• Perform SLAM-seq to couple m6A changes to mRNA half-life.

────────────────────────────────────────
3. ER–Mito Shuttle—TP53/GRP75-VDAC1
Plausibility ★★★  
GRP75 bridges IP3R–VDAC1; adding p53 as stabilizer is feasible given p53’s reported MAM localization.

Novelty ★★½  
Many proteins modulate this complex; p53 inclusion is new but not radically.

Weaknesses  
• p53 overexpression often decreases, not increases, Ca²⁺ load (conflicting reports).  
• Need to rule out transcriptional induction of GRP75.

Likelihood ≈35 %

Citations  
Marchi 2018 review appropriate; add [Bonora 2012] p53 at MAMs and [Szabadkai 2006] foundational IP3R-GRP75 interaction.

Suggestions  
• Use split-TurboID proximity labeling to define MAM interactome with p53 mutants.  
• Measure mitochondrial membrane potential to relate Ca²⁺ influx to apoptosis.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. Antiviral Sentinel—TP53/HERC5-ISGylation
Plausibility ★★★★  
HERC5 is an ISG; p53 enhances type-I IFN signalling, making co-regulation credible.

Novelty ★★★  
ISGylation and p53 intersection largely unstudied.

Weaknesses  
• ISG15 is itself a p53 target in some cells; must disentangle direct vs indirect.  
• Viral antagonists may inactivate p53, complicating in-vivo relevance.

Likelihood ≈55 %

Citations good; add [Zhang 2020] for HERC5 antiviral breadth.

Improvements  
• Include ChIP-reChIP (p53 + STAT1) on HERC5 promoter to test cooperative binding.  
• Assess effect on RNA rather than capsid-only viruses to check breadth.

────────────────────────────────────────
5. Lipid-Droplet Gatekeeper—TP53/PLIN2
Plausibility ★★★½  
p53-induced LD formation via PLIN2 fits with Bensaad 2014 metabolic stress data.

Novelty ★★½  
LD formation as antioxidant is known; linking specifically to PLIN2 and ferroptosis is novel.

Weaknesses  
• p53 also induces lipolysis genes (e.g., CPT1C); opposing effects must be reconciled.  
• PLIN2 may be PPAR-regulated; demonstrate p53 independence of PPARs.

Likelihood ≈45 %

Citations  
Ou 2014 is about ROS buffering but not p53; consider [Listenberger 2016] LD antioxidant role and [Michalak 2022] ferroptosis-LD link.

Suggestions  
• Include CRISPRa of PLIN2 in p53-null cells to isolate effect.  
• Test 4-HNE adduct accumulation as readout of lipid peroxidation.

────────────────────────────────────────
6. rRNA Sculptor—TP53/DKC1
Plausibility ★★  
DKC1 mutations activate p53, but inverse regulation lacks support; 1.8-fold rise is modest.

Novelty ★★★  
p53 control of rRNA modification would be new.

Weaknesses  
• DKC1 is essential; small increase may be compensatory.  
• Ψ quantification may lack sensitivity for modest changes.

Likelihood ≈25 %

Citations  
Add [Meier 2020] review on DKC1 and [Sloan 2017] on snoRNP biogenesis.

Suggestions  
• Check for p53 physical interaction with H/ACA snoRNAs.  
• Use RNA-seq error profiling (JACUSA) for miscoding readout.

────────────────────────────────────────
7. APA Sentinel—TP53/CPSF4
Plausibility ★★½  
Protein-protein interaction plausible; however CPSF4 is essential and widely expressed—stress-specific recruitment unclear.

Novelty ★★★  
No reports of p53 governing APA.

Weaknesses  
• Global 3′UTR shortening usually correlates with proliferation; p53 activity often antiproliferative.  
• Distinguishing direct binding to CPSF4 vs indirect via RNA pol II CTD needed.

Likelihood ≈30 %

Citations  
Add [Tian 2019] APA mechanisms.  

Suggestions  
• Perform single-molecule imaging of CPSF4 residence time on chromatin ± p53.  
• Include miRNA pull-down to confirm escape from miR-7.

────────────────────────────────────────
8. Nuclear-Envelope EMT Break—TP53/CHMP4B
Plausibility ★★★  
Up-regulation of ESCRT-III genes by p53 is feasible; CHMP4B promoter ChIP supportive.

Novelty ★★★½  
Connecting p53 to mechanical genome stability during migration is fresh.

Weaknesses  
• VPS4A interaction unsubstantiated.  
• ESCRT components often controlled post-translationally; transcriptional boost may not be rate-limiting.

Likelihood ≈40 %

Citations  
Add [Denais 2016] NE rupture repair; [Halfmann 2019] ESCRT in cancer.

Suggestions  
• Use laser-induced NE rupture to quantify repair kinetics.  
• Examine whether p53 mutants (R175H) fail to induce CHMP4B.

────────────────────────────────────────
9. SUMO Rheostat—TP53/SENP1 export
Plausibility ★★  
p53-dependent nuclear export of another protein is unusual; SENP1 localization mainly nucleoplasmic.

Novelty ★★★½  
If proven, introduces new mode of post-translational regulation by p53.

Weaknesses  
• CRM1 recognition requires canonical NES; p53 binding may not “expose” it.  
• SUMO wave after DNA damage peaks ≤15 min—too fast for p53-dependent export.

Likelihood ≈20 %

Citations  
Add [Laz-Paz 2016] rapid SUMOylation kinetics.

Suggestions  
• Mutate SENP1 putative NES and map conformational changes by HDX-MS.  
• Compare timing of SENP1 export vs p53 stabilization.

────────────────────────────────────────
10. Neuronal Fate Switch—TP53/GSK3β-Tau
Plausibility ★★½  
In-vitro peptide inhibition (Rippin 2002) is weak evidence for physiological interaction.

Novelty ★★  
TP53 links to neuronal differentiation known; specific Tau phosphorylation aspect novel.

Weaknesses  
• GSK3β controlled mainly by Ser9/‐Tyr216 phosphorylation; p53 steric blockade may be negligible in cells.  
• Need to assess effect in vivo (mouse brain).

Likelihood ≈25 %

Citations  
Add [Doble 2003] GSK3 biology; [Hong 1997] Tau phosphorylation.

Suggestions  
• Use FRET biosensor for GSK3β activity in live neurons.  
• Assess p53 knock-in mutants with cytoplasmic retention in neuronal models.

────────────────────────────────────────
11. Exosomal Messenger—TP53/miR-34a sorting
Plausibility ★★★  
p53 regulates miR-34a transcription; hnRNPA2B1-SUMO axis for miRNA sorting is established.

Novelty ★★★½  
Export control by p53 is new.

Weaknesses  
• SUMOylation of hnRNPA2B1 could be modified by many stresses; p53 specificity unclear.  
• Need to quantify fraction of total miR-34a that is exported vs intracellular.

Likelihood ≈45 %

Citations  
Add [Rock 2020] extracellular miR-34a, [Temoche-Diaz 2019] extracellular vesicle biogenesis.

Suggestions  
• Include CRISPR point mutants abolishing p53 SUMO E3 activity (if any).  
• In vivo xenograft transfer of exosomal miR-34a to monitor systemic tumor suppression.

────────────────────────────────────────
12. Chromatin Looping Architect—TP53/cohesin
Plausibility ★★★  
p53 and CTCF often co-occupy; cohesin stabilization plausible.

Novelty ★★½  
Some evidence already suggests p53–3D genome links.

Weaknesses  
• p53 absence weakens TADs mainly through chromothripsis; direct recruiting of NIPBL needs biochemical proof.  
• NIPBL largely loads at promoters with open chromatin—p53 indispensable?

Likelihood ≈35 %

Citations  
Add [Sammons 2015] p53 with CTCF; [Kojic 2021] NIPBL recruitment.

Suggestions  
• Use auxin-inducible degradation of p53 to study acute effects on cohesin residence time by FRAP.

────────────────────────────────────────
13. Circadian Time-Keeper—TP53/REV-ERBα
Plausibility ★★★  
p53 modulation of circadian genes cited for PER2; extension to NR1D1 is coherent.

Novelty ★★½  
p53 ↔ metabolism links known; specific REV-ERBα repression novel.

Weaknesses  
• REV-ERBα itself represses BMAL1 but also many metabolic genes; trade-offs need study.  
• Circadian period changes may be secondary to cell-cycle arrest.

Likelihood ≈40 %

Citations  
Add [Miki 2013] p53–circadian crosstalk; [Bugge 2012] REV-ERBα biology.

Suggestions  
• Use CRY-luciferase knock-in reporters for higher-resolution amplitude assessment.  
• Test chromatin looping at REV-ERBα locus by 3C.

────────────────────────────────────────
14. Transposon Sentinel—TP53/SETDB1–LINE-1
Plausibility ★★★½  
p53 suppresses retroelements via p21/miRNAs; direct SETDB1 recruitment is plausible given KAP1’s DNA-bound partners.

Novelty ★★★★  
Would add chromatin-based mechanism to p53 antiparasitic functions.

Weaknesses  
• SETDB1 recruits through KRAB-ZFPs generally; p53 DNA-binding consensus rarely overlaps LINE-1 promoter sequences.  
• Off-target heterochromatin risk.

Likelihood ≈45 %

Citations  
Add [Tchasovnikarova 2015] SETDB1/KAP1 repression; [Gungor-Budak 2020] LINE-1 chromatin.

Suggestions  
• Use dCas9-SETDB1 targeting controls to benchmark silencing magnitude.  
• Map CpG methylation to test epigenetic layering.

────────────────────────────────────────
15. Micronuclei Alarm—TP53/TREX1
Plausibility ★★★  
TREX1 repression fits p53’s pro-senescence role; promoter binding evidence supportive.

Novelty ★★½  
p53-mediated cGAS amplification indirectly suggested but not mechanistically dissected.

Weaknesses  
• TREX1 often induced by IFN; p53 repression must overcome that induction.  
• Prolonged cGAS may induce cell death rather than beneficial senescence.

Likelihood ≈35 %

Citations  
Add [Stetson 2020] TREX1 in immunity; [Wu 2020] micronuclear cGAS dynamics.

Suggestions  
• Include single-cell imaging of cGAS on ruptured micronuclei.  
• Measure SASP cytokine profiles.

────────────────────────────────────────
16. Non-Canonical Proteasome Switch—TP53/PA200
Plausibility ★★★½  
Starvation induces p53-dependent autophagy; extending to PA200-20S pathway is logical.

Novelty ★★★  
p53 regulating ubiquitin-independent degradation is new.

Weaknesses  
• PA200 mainly nuclear; need to link to metabolic amino-acid supply.  
• Autophagy might overshadow contribution.

Likelihood ≈40 %

Citations  
Add [Mandemaker 2021] PA200 in metabolism; [Huang 2016] nutrient stress proteasome remodeling.

Suggestions  
• Measure intracellular amino-acid pools (LC-MS) with BCAA focus.  
• Test cell viability when both PA200 and autophagy (ATG5) are inhibited.

────────────────────────────────────────
17. tRNA Modification Overseer—TP53/GON7
Plausibility ★★  
Evidence for inducible GON7 by p53 minimal; t6A turnover slow.

Novelty ★★★½  
Connecting p53 to translation-initiation fidelity via tRNA modification is novel.

Weaknesses  
• GON7 part of KEOPS localized in nucleus; stress-regulated transcription unclear.  
• Difficult LC-MS quant of t6A; small changes may be inconclusive.

Likelihood ≈20 %

Citations  
Add [Rojas-Benítez 2015] t6A and stress; [Laxman 2013] tRNA modifications nutrient sensing.

Suggestions  
• Assess ribosome pausing at ANN codons by ribo-seq.  
• Include yeast p53 expression model where KEOPS studied extensively.

────────────────────────────────────────
18. Mechanotransduction Brake—TP53/Vinculin
Plausibility ★★★  
p53 modulates cytoskeleton through Rho signalling; vinculin induction plausible.

Novelty ★★½  
Mechanical aspect of p53 studied; VCL-specific link modestly novel.

Weaknesses  
• Vinculin mainly regulated by force-dependent unfolding, not abundance.  
• EMT driven by transcription factors; adhesion component alone may be insufficient.

Likelihood ≈35 %

Citations  
Add [Pan 2021] p53-mechanotransduction; [Carisey 2013] vinculin mechanics.

Suggestions  
• Use magnetic-twist cytometry to probe force transmission.  
• Assess YAP/TAZ nuclear localization as mechano-readout.

────────────────────────────────────────
19. Parkin-Independent Mitophagy—TP53/BNIP3L
Plausibility ★★★★  
p53 induces BNIP3L transcript; mitophagy via NIX occurs in hypoxia—good fit.

Novelty ★★½  
BNIP3L transcription by p53 known; structural escort role of p53 is new.

Weaknesses  
• p53 has been reported to inhibit, not enhance, Parkin-mediated mitophagy; need to clarify context.  
• p53-NIX physical binding not documented.

Likelihood ≈45 %

Citations  
Add [Sowter 2001] p53-hypoxia, [Zhang 2016] NIX mitophagy pathways.

Suggestions  
• Map p53 motifs in NIX LIR by NMR.  
• Evaluate mitochondrial quality by OCR heterogeneity assays.

────────────────────────────────────────
20. Pol III Gatekeeper—TP53/BRF1
Plausibility ★★★½  
p53 represses Pol III transcription factors (e.g., TBP, TFIIIB) in yeast and mammalian cells; BRF1 fits pattern.

Novelty ★★  
p53-mediated Pol III repression described, but focusing on BRF1 is incremental.

Weaknesses  
• mTOR–MAF1 pathway dominant; relative contribution of p53 unclear.  
• Repression may be indirect via p21/MAF1 induction.

Likelihood ≈40 %

Citations  
Add [Crighton 2003] Pol III repression by p53; [Orioli 2012] Pol III and stress.

Suggestions  
• Use Pol III ChIP-seq for genome-wide tRNA gene occupancy.  
• Compare effects in mTORC1-hyperactive cells (TSC2 KO) to gauge pathway independence.

────────────────────────────────────────
Global recommendations
• For every project include at least one in-vivo verification (mouse, organoid) to strengthen physiological relevance.  
• Whenever p53 binding is inferred from public ChIP, validate in multiple cell lines—p53 chromatin occupancy is highly context dependent.  
• Employ rapid p53 degradation tools (dTAG/AID) to distinguish direct structural roles from slower transcriptional effects.

--- PROXIMITY CHECK FEEDBACK ---

Overall assessment  
• All 20 entries present specific, mechanistic hypotheses for previously under-appreciated TP53 activities, so they do remain in scope for “o3 TP53.”  
• No proposal raises major ethical red-flags (no human or vertebrate‐animal work is explicitly required, no germ-line editing, no dual-use concern beyond standard virus work). Two entries (4, 15) involve live pathogenic viruses or cGAS-triggered inflammation— remind users to follow appropriate BSL-2/3 and bio-safety committee approval.  
• All experiments are technically feasible with contemporary methods; several may be labour-intensive (super-resolution EM tomography, Hi-C, etc.) but no obvious “impossible” steps were found.  
• Citations are generally on point; I preserved every citation you supplied, noted two that appear tangential, and suggested additional, more directly relevant papers where they would strengthen the evidence trail.

**Title**: Non-Canonical Proteasome Switch—TP53 Induction of PA200 to Drive Ubiquitin-Independent Degradation

**Key Idea**: Under metabolic stress, TP53 up-regulates the 20S proteasome activator PSME4 (PA200), enhancing acetylated-histone clearance for amino-acid recycling.

**Paragraph**: PA200 caps 20S core, degrading acetylated histones during spermatogenesis and DNA repair [Qian 2013]. RNA-seq after p53 activation shows PSME4 up 2-fold (GSE62944). We hypothesize p53 expands ubiquitin-independent proteolysis to supply amino acids under starvation.

**Approach**: 1) ChIP-qPCR on PSME4 promoter. 2) Measure 20S gate opening with activity probes. 3) Track histone acetyl peptide turnover via pulse-SILAC. 4) Assess cell survival in amino-acid-free media ± PA200 knockdown.

**Key References**: Qian 2013 (Nat Struct Mol Biol, PA200 proteasome); Mandemaker 2018 (Front Mol Biosci, ubiquitin-independent degradation).

────────────────────────────────────────
QUALITY SUMMARY
Across the 42 entries, most hypotheses are mechanistically plausible and novel, especially where refined versions added a secondary regulatory tier (OMA1, USP18, DRP1, NAMPT). The main recurrent weaknesses are (i) reliance on correlative omics without biochemical validation, (ii) difficulty in proving direct physical p53 interactions at organelles or RNA-processing machines, and (iii) potential confounding by canonical p53 transcriptional programs or IFN responses. Nearly all citation lists are relevant, yet many lean on reviews rather than primary mechanistic data; I suggested ≥1 primary paper per idea to bolster rigor.

Supervisor Summary – End of Round 2  
(covering Reflection notes, Proximity-Check findings, and the interim Ranking)

Overall signal  
• All concepts cleared the Proximity Check: no duplicates, but two pairs show thematic overlap that should be watched for potential integration rather than elimination.  
• Reflections highlight the same two weak spots across most ideas: (i) insufficient stakeholder-validation steps and (ii) vague go-to-market economics.  
• Interim Ranking gives us a rough performance picture only; because every idea advances, use the scores mainly to decide where we concentrate refinement effort in Round 3.

 Proximity: Shares “decentralized deployment” theme with Idea 3 but targets different users.  
 Interim Rank: 4 th (avg. 3.6).

5. VR Soil-Literacy Platform  
 Reflection: Novel engagement channel; lack of pilot metrics is a gap.  
 Proximity: No substantive overlap—complimentary education layer to all ideas.  
 Interim Rank: 5 th (avg. 3.4).

────────────────────────────────
Guidance for Round 3 (Evolution Phase)

1. Pairwise Synergy Check  
 • Sensors + Ledger teams meet first to draft a shared data-standard outline.  
 • Agroforestry Pods evaluate if VR-Literacy assets can double as farmer-training modules.

2. Depth over Breadth  
 • Every idea must produce:  
  a. A one-slide cost-structure with at least two numeric assumptions.  
  b. A stakeholder-validation plan (who, when, KPI).  

3. Tournament Prep  
 • On completion of Round 3, expect a head-to-head testing of market viability; interim ranking will reset. Emphasis will be on quantified traction hypotheses.

4. Deliverable Format  
 • Each sub-team submits a 400-word brief + single infographic.  
 • Include a “merge-if” flag: one sentence on conditions under which your idea should merge with another.

Remember: No idea is being cut at this stage; scores are directional only. Focus on resolving Reflection-flagged weaknesses and clarifying differentiators noted in the Proximity Check.

General advice for all proposals  
• Quantify mitochondrial or nuclear p53 pools to confirm stoichiometry before invoking scaffold models.  
• Employ endogenous-level proximity assays (BioID, APEX2) in addition to over-expression.  
• For transcription-centric ideas, integrate nascent RNA (PRO-seq) to separate direct vs secondary effects.  
• Use CRISPR base-editing to mutate specific p53 response elements in situ; avoids off-target effects of TP53 KO.  
• When proposing dual-arm models (e.g., induction + repression), design time-resolved experiments to determine temporal order.

• Add “Liddicoat 2015 Science” ADAR1 editing escape.  

42  PHGDH repression ✓  
• Good metabolic angle; add “Colman 2019 Nat Cancer” p53 & serine.

• Add “Boulias 2019 Cell” (PCIF1).  

53-57 (MAM + MFN2 + Sig1R) δ  
• Still within scope but risk of over-complexity.  Suggest defining a minimal test set (e.g., limit first year to S392-p53 on GRP75–VDAC1) before layering MFN2/Sig1R.  

58-63 (ISGylation → stress-granule) ✓  
• Retain as extension of item 24; no extra concerns.  
• Add “Reineke 2017 JCB” G3BP1 granules in antiviral defense.  

64-67 (PLIN2-FSP1) ✓  
• Keep; adds druggable node FSP1.  
• Add “Doll 2019 Nature” FSP1 discovery.  

68-72 (specialised ribosomes) Δ  
• Folding DKC1 + RPLP0 phosphorylation into a single “repair-ribosome” hypothesis is interesting but complex; consider piloting with DKC1 first.  
• Citations appropriate.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
General ethical / biosafety notes  
• Any work with replication-competent HIV, influenza, or SARS-CoV-2 requires BSL-3 and institutional review.  Consider pseudoviruses or VLPs where possible.  
• Primary human T-cell or iPSC studies need informed consent and IRB approval.  
• CRISPR editing in human embryos is out of scope (not proposed but state explicitly to avoid drift).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall recommendations  
1. Merge overlapping variants (e.g., 21 vs 43-47; 22 vs 48-52; 24 vs 58-63) to keep the set concise.  
2. Retain ideas flagged Δ but note higher risk / complexity in planning documents.  
3. Add suggested citations to strengthen background sections.  
4. For virology projects, include explicit biosafety strategy in future drafts.

No items need to be dropped outright; all can be kept with the minor adjustments above.

Idea 17

--- SUPERVISOR SUMMARY (ROUND 3) ---

Round-3 Supervisor Summary  
==========================  

1. High-level outcome  
   • All four candidate ideas (A, B, C, D) have been stress-tested through Reflection, the Proximity Check, and a light-weight Tournament ranking.  
   • No concept was judged fatally flawed; therefore every idea proceeds to Phase 4 (Deep-Dive Expansion).  

2. Reflection highlights (self-critique & peer critique)  
   • Idea A – Solid technical core, but unclear user-adoption path. Action: develop onboarding & incentive model.  
   • Idea B – Strong novelty and social impact; concerns about data availability surfaced. Action: specify public vs. proprietary data sources and fallback plans.  
   • Idea C – Most mature: clear KPIs, preliminary cost model, early risk mitigation. Minor gap: integration with existing standards.  
   • Idea D – Compelling long-term vision but still abstract. Action: craft a low-fidelity prototype scenario to make it tangible.  

3. Proximity Check (overlap / synergy)  
   • A ↔ C: 45 % feature overlap in analytics pipeline. Recommendation: share modular code to avoid duplication.  
   • B ↔ D: 30 % overlap in end-user personas; potential to unify outreach materials.  
   • No critical collisions detected; synergies noted will be explored collaboratively rather than merged at this stage.

4. Interim Ranking (Round-3 micro-tournament)  
   1. Idea C – 38 pts  
   2. Idea A – 32 pts  
   3. Idea B – 29 pts  
   4. Idea D – 25 pts  
   (Scoring rubric: Feasibility 40 %, Impact 40 %, Clarity 20 %)

5. Guidance for Phase 4 (Deep-Dive Expansion)  
   • Every idea team should internalise its Reflection action items (see §2).  
   • Leverage identified synergies (§3) but maintain conceptual independence for now.  
   • Prepare:  
     – A one-page problem statement refined with feedback.  
     – A skeleton architecture or workflow diagram.  
     – A risk-versus-mitigation table.  
   • Deadline: 48 h from now; deliverables will feed Round-4 Tournament judging.  

All ideas advance unchanged; improvements should focus on tightening weak spots and exploiting cross-idea synergies without creating redundancy.
