**Title**: Quantum Error Correction with Machine Learning-Optimized Quantum Error Correction Codes and Error Thresholds

**Key Idea**: Machine learning can be used to optimize quantum error correction codes and error thresholds to improve the robustness of quantum computations against decoherence.

**Paragraph**: Quantum error correction codes and error thresholds play a crucial role in determining the reliability of quantum computations. By using machine learning techniques to optimize these codes and thresholds, it is possible to improve the overall performance of quantum computers and reduce the effects of decoherence [Gottesman 1997, Chen 2018]. Furthermore, the use of machine learning can help to identify and mitigate the effects of noise in quantum systems, which is a major challenge in the development of reliable quantum computers [Preskill 2018].

**Approach**: The implementation would involve training machine learning models on simulated data of quantum computations under various noise conditions, using metrics such as error correction fidelity as the target for optimization. The trained models would then be applied to real quantum systems to select and adjust quantum error correction codes and error thresholds in real-time, ensuring optimal performance under different error scenarios.
