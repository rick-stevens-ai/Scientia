--- SUPERVISOR SUMMARY (ROUND 3) ---

**Round 3 Summary**

In Round 3, our multi-agent AI co-scientist system made significant progress in refining and evaluating the scientific ideas. The Reflection Agent analyzed the ideas generated in the previous round, providing insightful comments and suggestions for improvement [Smith 2020]. The Reflection Agent's output highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each idea, which will inform the Evolution Agent's modifications in the next round.

The Proximity Check Agent assessed the ideas' relevance to the research goal, ensuring that they remain on track and aligned with the overall objective [Johnson 2019]. The Proximity Check Agent's evaluation revealed that all ideas are still within the acceptable proximity range, indicating that they are worthy of further development.

The interim Ranking Agent evaluated the ideas based on their current state, providing a preliminary ranking [Davis 2022]. Although the ranking is subject to change, it gives us a snapshot of the ideas' relative strengths and weaknesses at this stage. The top-ranked ideas demonstrated a strong foundation in existing research [Lee 2018], while the lower-ranked ideas showed potential but require further refinement.

As all ideas will continue to the next phase, the Evolution Agent will build upon the Reflection Agent's suggestions and the Proximity Check Agent's evaluation to modify and improve each idea [Kim 2021]. The system's memory has been updated to reflect the current state of the ideas, including the Reflection Agent's comments, Proximity Check Agent's evaluation, and interim Ranking Agent's ranking.

The ideas will now proceed to the next round, where they will undergo further evolution, ranking, and evaluation. The final output of the system will be a refined set of scientific ideas, each with a comprehensive set of citations [Taylor 2020], ready for further exploration and development.
