  "content": "Persistent DSBs in stem cell niches not only drive clonal expansion of mutated cells but also alter niche signaling, facilitating immune evasion and early neoplastic progression.  \n*Supporting evidence:* DNA damage in stem cells can lead to clonal evolution and tumor initiation [Blanpain 2013]. Immune escape mechanisms are observed in pre-malignant clones [Schreiber 2011, Science; \"Cancer immunoediting\"].\n\n---"
