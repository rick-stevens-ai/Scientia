  "content": "Exposure to environmental genotoxins (e.g., ionizing radiation, certain chemicals) elevates DSBs, and individuals with polymorphisms in DNA repair genes display disproportionately higher neoplasia risk, suggesting gene-environment interactions as critical modifiers of cancer susceptibility.  \n*Supporting evidence:* Ionizing radiation is a well-known inducer of DSBs and is epidemiologically linked to cancer risk [Preston 2007]. Genetic variation in DNA repair capacity modulates cancer risk [Goode 2002, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev].\n\n---"
