Some citations could be updated or supplemented with more recent or foundational literature.\n- **General Recommendations:**  \n  - Sharpen hypotheses with concrete molecular targets, mechanisms, or clinical endpoints.\n  - Consider emerging technologies (single-cell, spatial omics, AI-driven diagnostics).\n  - Integrate patient stratification and real-world implementation challenges.\n\nIf you wish to cluster or evolve these by cancer type, mechanism, or translational strategy, I recommend grouping by (1) detection/biomarker, (2) therapy/target, (3) microenvironment/intervention, and (4) aging/systemic approaches for the next iteration."
