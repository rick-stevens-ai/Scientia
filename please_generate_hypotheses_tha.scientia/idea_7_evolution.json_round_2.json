  "content": "Chronic inflammation generates reactive oxygen species that induce DSBs, and the resulting DNA damage response triggers secretion of pro-tumorigenic cytokines, creating a feedback loop that accelerates neoplastic transformation in epithelial tissues.  \n*Supporting evidence:* Inflammation-induced ROS can cause DSBs and are implicated in carcinogenesis [Kawanishi 2017]. SASP and cytokine secretion link DNA damage and inflammation in cancer [Coppe 2010].\n\n---"
