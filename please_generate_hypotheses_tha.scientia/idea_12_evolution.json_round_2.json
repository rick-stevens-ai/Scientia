  "content": "Loss of p53-mediated apoptosis after DSBs enables survival and proliferation of genomically unstable, pre-neoplastic cells, and reactivation of p53 in these cells triggers immunogenic cell death, providing a rationale for p53-based therapies.  \n*Supporting evidence:* p53 is a key tumor suppressor responding to DSBs [Vousden 2007]. Reactivation of p53 can induce antitumor immunity [Sen 2021, Nature].\n\n---"
