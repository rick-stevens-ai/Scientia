  "content": "Defective ATM kinase signaling fails to arrest the cell cycle after DSBs and also impairs the initiation of immune surveillance pathways, allowing propagation and immune escape of genomically unstable, pre-neoplastic cells.  \n*Supporting evidence:* ATM deficiency leads to ataxia-telangiectasia and increased cancer susceptibility [Shiloh 2001]. ATM is involved in immunological DNA sensing [Hartlova 2015, Nat Immunol].\n\n---"
