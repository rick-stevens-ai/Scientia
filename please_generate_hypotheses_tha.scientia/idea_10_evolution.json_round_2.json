  "content": "DSBs in telomeric regions promote chromosome end-to-end fusions, leading to breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, and the resulting complex rearrangements create neoantigens that may be targetable by immunotherapies.  \n*Supporting evidence:* Telomere dysfunction leads to DSBs and chromosomal instability in cancer [Artandi 2010]. Chromosomal instability generates immunogenic neoantigens [McGranahan 2016, Cell].\n\n---"
