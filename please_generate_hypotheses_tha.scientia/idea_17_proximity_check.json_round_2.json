  "content": "Epigenetic alterations affecting DSB repair gene expression increase neoplasia susceptibility, and epigenetic therapy can restore repair capacity and suppress tumorigenesis in pre-malignant cells.  \n*Supporting evidence:* Epigenetic silencing of repair genes is observed in cancers [Esteller 2008]. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can restore expression of silenced repair genes [Teodoridis 2004, Cancer Res].\n\n---\n\n--- PROXIMITY CHECK FEEDBACK ---\n\n**Proximity Check and Alignment Review**\n\n**Overall Scope and Alignment:**  \nAll 20 hypotheses directly relate double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) to neoplasia and are well grounded in the molecular, cellular, and translational cancer biology literature. The scope is appropriate for this research goal, spanning mechanisms (repair, mutational signatures), environmental/genetic factors, therapeutic implications, biomarkers, and microenvironmental effects. There are no major ethical or feasibility concerns; all hypotheses are testable with current technologies, and no suggestion involves unethical experimentation or inappropriate human/animal use.
