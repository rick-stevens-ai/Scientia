Constructive feedback was provided, identifying areas for improvement such as clarifying experimental methodologies and strengthening theoretical frameworks. The Reflection agent highlighted which concepts were particularly promising and flagged any redundancy or potential overlaps among the ideas.\n\n**Proximity Check:**  \nIn the Proximity Check phase, each idea was assessed for its similarity to existing literature and prior proposals. The agent confirmed that all ideas maintained a suitable level of novelty, with no significant duplication or excessive overlap with established work. Minor overlaps were noted, but these were considered acceptable and did not compromise the originality of the proposals.\n\n**Interim Ranking:**  \nThe interim Ranking phase involved prioritizing the ideas based on their potential impact, feasibility, and innovation. The ranking order provided valuable guidance for resource allocation and future refinement, but all ideas were deemed sufficiently strong to warrant continued development.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll ideas have demonstrated adequate progress through Reflection, Proximity Check, and interim Ranking. Based on these outcomes, all ideas will proceed to the next phase for further iteration and improvement."
