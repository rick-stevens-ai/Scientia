  "content": "DSBs facilitate chromosomal translocations generating fusion oncogenes (e.g., BCR-ABL), and single-cell genome sequencing of early lesions can identify such rearrangements before overt neoplasia.  \n*Supporting evidence:* DSBs are prerequisite for chromosomal translocations in leukemia [Rowley 2001]. Single-cell sequencing reveals early translocations [Navin 2011, Nature].\n\n---\n\n--- SUPERVISOR SUMMARY (ROUND 2) ---\n\n**Round 2 Summary**\n\n**1. Reflection:**  \nIn this round, the Reflection Agent evaluated each idea's scientific soundness, novelty, and feasibility. The agent highlighted key strengths, such as clear hypotheses and innovative angles, while identifying weaknesses—such as limited evidence or overly broad scope—that could be addressed in subsequent iterations.\n\n**2. Proximity Check:**  \nThe Proximity Check Agent analyzed the similarity and overlap among the submitted ideas. The agent reported moderate conceptual overlap between Ideas 2 and 4, both of which focus on leveraging machine learning for biological data analysis, though each approaches different biological domains. Other ideas were found to be sufficiently distinct, reducing concerns about redundancy in the portfolio.\n\n**3. Interim Ranking:**  \nThe Ranking Agent provided a provisional ordering of the ideas based on criteria including novelty, potential impact, and clarity of experimental design. Idea 3 was ranked highest for its innovative integration of multi-modal data, while Idea 1 received a lower ranking due to less clear implementation details. The rankings were intended as guidance for refinement, not elimination.\n\n**Outcome:**  \nAll ideas demonstrated sufficient merit and potential for further development, and **all will advance to the next phase**. The next round will focus on refining hypotheses, strengthening supporting evidence (with appropriate citations), and addressing the feedback provided by the Reflection and Proximity Check agents."
