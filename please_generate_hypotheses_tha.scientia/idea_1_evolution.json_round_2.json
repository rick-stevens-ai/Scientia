  "content": "Cells with defective non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DSBs not only exhibit increased neoplastic transformation due to genomic instability, but also show specific mutational signatures and structural rearrangements that could be used as biomarkers for early cancer detection.  \n*Supporting evidence:* NHEJ deficiency is linked to increased cancer risk due to accumulation of chromosomal aberrations [Jackson 2009]. Mutational signatures of error-prone repair have been characterized in tumor genomes [Alexandrov 2013, Nature; \"Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer\"].\n\n---"
