  "content": "Oncogene-induced replication stress elevates DSB frequency, which, in addition to driving chromosomal rearrangements, creates a dependency on specific DSB repair pathways, presenting a synthetic lethality opportunity for cancer therapy.  \n*Supporting evidence:* Replication stress and DSBs are frequently observed in early tumorigenesis [Kotsantis 2018]. Targeting DNA repair vulnerabilities is an emerging therapeutic strategy [Lord 2017, Science; \"PARP inhibitors: Synthetic lethality in the clinic\"].\n\n---"
