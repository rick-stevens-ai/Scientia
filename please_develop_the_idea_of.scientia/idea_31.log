**Title**: Secure Cloud-Connected IR Scanners with Integrated Privacy Controls for Population-Level Epidemiological Surveillance

**Key Idea**: Portable IR scanners with secure, privacy-preserving cloud connectivity aggregate anonymized population temperature data in real time for public health surveillance.

**Paragraph**: Real-time, geolocated fever data can dramatically improve outbreak detection and resource allocation. Adding privacy-preserving algorithms to secure transmission ensures ethical data collection, while integrating with existing public health data systems enables epidemiologists to track trends, support modeling, and guide interventions.

**Approach**: Develop secure, privacy-focused transmission protocols; integrate with health data platforms; pilot in clinics/hubs; evaluate epidemiological model improvements and public acceptability.

**Key References**: [Sun 2020]; [Moridani 2020].

**Modifications**:  
- Added privacy-preserving controls and integration with public health platforms.  
- Strengthens ethical deployment and data utility.  
- No new citations needed.
