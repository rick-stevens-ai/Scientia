**Title**: Multiplexed Wide-Angle IR Scanner with Real-Time Automated Anomaly Detection and Dynamic Queue Management for Mass Screening

**Key Idea**: An array-based, wide-angle IR scanner with real-time automated anomaly detection and dynamic queue management optimizes throughput and resource allocation in high-volume screening environments.

**Paragraph**: The system now includes dynamic queue management, prioritizing flagged individuals for secondary screening and balancing staff workload during surges. Automated, privacy-preserving reporting ensures compliance and efficient follow-up, crucial for outbreak control in airports, schools, and large events.

**Approach**: Develop wide-angle IR arrays and dynamic queue management algorithms; validate in simulated high-traffic settings, measuring impact on throughput and screening accuracy.

**Key References**: [Moridani 2020]; [Ng 2009]; **[Sun 2020]** (queue management, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added dynamic queue management and privacy-preserving reporting.
- Strengthens operational efficiency and compliance.
