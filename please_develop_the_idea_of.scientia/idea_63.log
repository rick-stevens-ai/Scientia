**Title**: Integration of Infrared Thermography with Wearable Biosensors for Multi-Modal, Continuous Health Monitoring and Early Infection Detection

**Key Idea**: Combining infrared thermography with wearable biosensors (heart rate, SpO2, sweat analytes) enables comprehensive, multi-modal, real-time detection of infection or systemic illness.

**Paragraph**: Multi-modal health monitoring increases sensitivity and specificity in early detection of infections and systemic illness. By fusing continuous IR thermography data with physiologic signals from wearable biosensors, algorithms can detect subtle deviations from an individualâ€™s baseline, prompting early intervention while minimizing false alarms. This

**Approach**: is especially valuable for high-risk populations and pandemic preparedness.

**Approach**: Integrate IR and biosensors (e.g., in wearable patches/garments); develop data fusion and anomaly detection algorithms; pilot in high-risk cohorts, measuring detection sensitivity versus single-modality systems.
