**Title**: Digital Twin Platform for Personalized Health Surveillance Using Continuous Infrared Thermography and Wearable Data

**Key Idea**: Creating a personalized digital twin by integrating continuous IR thermography and wearable sensor data enables individualized baseline modeling and early anomaly detection for precision health monitoring.

**Paragraph**: The digital twin concept models an individual’s physiology in real time, allowing for personalized detection of deviations that signal illness or injury. By continuously ingesting IR and biosensor data, machine learning algorithms refine the digital twin’s baseline, enabling highly sensitive, proactive health surveillance. This supports precision medicine and can seamlessly interface with telemedicine for timely, individualized care.

**Approach**: Build a digital twin platform ingesting real-time IR and wearable data; train models to establish and update personal baselines; pilot with volunteers, assessing impact on early illness detection and user engagement.
