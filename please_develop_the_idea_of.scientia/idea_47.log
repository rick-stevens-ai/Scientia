**Title**: Disposable, Color-Changing Infrared Strip with NFC-Enabled Digital Logging for Rapid, Hygienic Pediatric and Mass Fever Screening

**Key Idea**: A single-use, colorimetric IR strip with NFC-enabled digital logging supports rapid, hygienic fever screening and automated digital record-keeping in children and large population settings.

**Paragraph**: Outbreaks and pediatric care require not just speed and hygiene but also reliable data capture. The refined strip uses embedded NFC chips for instant app-based logging, ensuring traceability and seamless integration with health records. The colorimetric change remains easy to interpret visually, while digital logging supports analytics and epidemiological tracking.

**Approach**: Develop IR-sensitive, colorimetric strips with NFC chips; create companion app for instant data capture; field-test for accuracy, usability, and integration in clinics and schools.

**Key References**: [Ng 2009]; [Sund-Levander 2002]; [Stoppa 2014]; **[Moridani 2020]** (for digital record-keeping, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added NFC-enabled digital logging and health record integration.
- Strengthens data traceability and public health monitoring.
- New citation for digital records in screening.
