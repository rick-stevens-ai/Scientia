**Title**: Self-Calibrating IR Scanner with Environmental Sensing and Adaptive User Guidance for Reliable Home Monitoring

**Key Idea**: Automated calibration routines with environmental sensing and adaptive user prompts ensure consistent, reliable temperature readings from portable IR scanners in variable home settings.

**Paragraph**: Home IR thermography is prone to error from ambient temperature shifts and user technique. Embedding environmental sensors (e.g., ambient temperature, humidity), self-calibration, and adaptive prompts (e.g., “move closer”) improves data reliability and user confidence, especially for self-monitoring.

**Approach**: Develop calibration algorithms with integrated environmental sensors; simulate diverse home conditions; implement adaptive user feedback; evaluate impact on diagnostic accuracy among lay users.

**Key References**: [Ng 2009]; [Vardasca 2019].

**Modifications**:  
- Added environmental sensing and adaptive user guidance.  
- Strengthens consistency and user-friendliness.  
- No new citations needed.
