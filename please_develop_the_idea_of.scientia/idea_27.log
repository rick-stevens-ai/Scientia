**Title**: Connected Ultra-Portable IR Scanner for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Prevention with Personalized Alerts

**Key Idea**: A pocket-sized, connected IR scanner with individual trend analysis and alerting supports routine home monitoring to detect early diabetic foot ulcer risk.

**Paragraph**: Diabetic foot complications can be prevented with early detection of abnormal temperature patterns. Including wireless connectivity and personalized analytic dashboards enables patients and clinicians to track trends, receive early warnings, and optimize interventions. This

**Approach**: harnesses routine, self-administered scans to reduce morbidity and healthcare costs.

**Approach**: Design a hand-held, connected IR device and patient-facing app; conduct longitudinal studies with real-time trend analysis and alerting; correlate with clinical outcomes.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [van Netten 2014]; **[Sun 2020]** (digital health monitoring, new).

**Modifications**:  
- Added connectivity and personalized trend analytics.  
- Strengthens early detection and user engagement.  
- New citation for digital health monitoring.
