**Title**: Multiplexed Wide-Angle IR Scanner with Real-Time Automated Anomaly Detection for Mass Screening

**Key Idea**: An array-based portable IR scanner with automated detection algorithms can simultaneously scan multiple individuals and flag temperature anomalies in real time for high-throughput screening.

**Paragraph**: Outbreaks and busy clinics require rapid, high-volume screening. A wide-angle, multiplexed IR scanner with real-time automated anomaly detection can process multiple individuals simultaneously, minimizing bottlenecks and alerting staff to cases requiring further evaluation, thereby improving efficiency and early detection.

**Approach**: Build a wide field-of-view IR sensor array; develop and validate real-time detection and alert algorithms; test throughput and accuracy in high-traffic simulations.

**Key References**: [Moridani 2020]; [Ng 2009].

**Modifications**:  
- Emphasized real-time, automated detection and alerting.  
- Strengthens throughput and operator efficiency.  
- No new citations needed.
