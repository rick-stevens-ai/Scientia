**Title**: Secure, Privacy-Preserving Cloud-Connected IR Scanners with Real-Time Epidemiological Analytics for Population Surveillance

**Key Idea**: Portable IR scanners with secure, privacy-preserving cloud connectivity and real-time analytics support anonymized, population-level temperature surveillance and early outbreak detection.

**Paragraph**: Real-time analytics now flag epidemiological trends and anomalies, supporting proactive public health interventions. Advanced privacy-preserving algorithms ensure compliance with data regulations and enhance public trust, while modular APIs allow integration with diverse health IT infrastructures.

**Approach**: Implement privacy-preserving analytics and modular APIs; validate in clinics and public hubs; measure impact on outbreak detection and public trust.

**Key References**: [Sun 2020]; [Moridani 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added real-time analytics and modular health IT integration.
- Strengthens population-level surveillance and system interoperability.
