**Title**: IR Scanner with Multimodal Voice, Gesture, and Eye-Tracking Controls, Contextual Accessibility Profiles, and Sterile-Mode Operation

**Key Idea**: Integrating voice, gesture, and eye-tracking controls with user-specific accessibility profiles and sterile-mode operation maximizes IR scanner usability for all users and settings.

**Paragraph**: Contextual accessibility profiles adapt interface modalities based on user ability and environment (e.g., OR, disability, field), while a sterile-mode disables all physical touchpoints [Heikenfeld 2018]. Multimodal controls (voice, gesture, eye-tracking) ensure universal access and reduce procedural errors.

**Approach**: Implement multimodal controls and adaptive profiles; test in diverse clinical and disability settings; assess usability, error rates, and accessibility.

**Key References**: [Stoppa 2014]; [Sun 2020]; [Heikenfeld 2018].

**Modifications**:
- Added contextual accessibility profiles and sterile-mode.
- Strengthens universal usability and infection control.
