**Title**: AI-Enhanced Handheld IR Scanner with Injury-Specific Guidance for Musculoskeletal Assessment

**Key Idea**: A portable IR scanner with embedded AI and injury-specific guidance can detect and classify musculoskeletal injuries, providing step-by-step prompts for optimal image capture and interpretation.

**Paragraph**: Musculoskeletal injuries often display subtle or complex thermal patterns. Adding AI-driven guidance for image acquisition (e.g., prompts for positioning, timing) and detailed classification of injury types enhances the accuracy and usability of handheld IR scanners in pre-hospital, sports, or outpatient settings. This

**Approach**: reduces operator dependence and supports rapid triage and referral decisions.

**Approach**: Train deep learning models on large, annotated IR image datasets; integrate real-time guidance and feedback into handheld hardware; validate in clinical trials for various injury types and user skill levels.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [Vardasca 2019].

**Modifications**:  
- Added AI-based user guidance for image capture.  
- Strengthens diagnostic accuracy and ease of use.  
- No new citations needed (already covered).
