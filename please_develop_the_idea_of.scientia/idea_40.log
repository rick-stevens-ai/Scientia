**Title**: Multi-Spectral Portable IR Scanner with AI-Based Tissue Pathology Differentiation and Decision Support

**Key Idea**: A portable scanner capturing multiple IR wavelengths, combined with AI-based tissue classification and decision support, enables precise, real-time differentiation of various pathologies.

**Paragraph**: Different tissue pathologies emit distinct thermal signatures. Combining multi-spectral IR imaging with AI-driven tissue classification and decision support enhances specificity in detecting tumors, inflammation, or vascular changes in point-of-care settings, supporting rapid diagnosis and triage.

**Approach**: Develop a multi-spectral IR sensor platform; train machine learning models on labeled pathology spectra; validate diagnostic accuracy and clinical workflow integration.

**Key References**: [Vardasca 2019]; [Ring 2012].

**Modifications**:  
- Added AI-based tissue classification and decision support.  
- Strengthens real-time precision and clinical relevance.  
- No new citations needed.
