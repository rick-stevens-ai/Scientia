**Title**: Textile-Integrated IR Sensing Garments with Multi-Zone Analytics, Adaptive Haptic/Visual Feedback, and Washable, Modular Design for Continuous Health Monitoring

**Key Idea**: Garments with distributed IR sensors, adaptive multi-zone analytics, haptic/visual feedback, and washable modular components provide durable, continuous monitoring for proactive health management.

**Paragraph**: The garmentâ€™s modular sensor arrays are now detachable/washable, increasing longevity and hygiene [Stoppa 2014], [Tognetti 2012]. Adaptive analytics map multi-zone data to user-specific baselines, issuing graded feedback (from subtle to urgent) and optionally triggering remote clinician alerts. This makes the system practical for elderly, athletes, and occupational health.

**Approach**: Develop modular, washable garments with multi-zone sensors; adaptive feedback and optional clinician integration; field-test for comfort, durability, and clinical value.

**Key References**: [Stoppa 2014]; [Tognetti 2012]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added washable/modular design for durability.
- Graded feedback and user-specific analytics.
- Strengthens usability, longevity, and clinical integration.
