**Title**: Self-Calibrating IR Scanner with Context-Aware Environmental Sensing and Proactive User Education for Reliable Home Monitoring

**Key Idea**: Automated self-calibration, context-aware environmental sensing, and proactive user education ensure consistent, high-quality IR scans by non-professionals in diverse home environments.

**Paragraph**: The device now includes context-aware prompts (e.g., “room temperature too high—wait” or “improve lighting”), and a built-in tutorial mode to educate users on proper technique, further reducing errors and increasing trust in results.

**Approach**: Develop context-aware calibration and tutorial software; test with lay users in varied home conditions; measure impact on scan quality and user confidence.

**Key References**: [Ng 2009]; [Vardasca 2019].

**Modifications**:
- Added context-aware prompts and built-in user education.
- Strengthens data quality and user engagement.
