# Final Report: Idea 12

## Final ELO Score: 1498.3

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Contactless, Automated Neonatal IR Scanning System with AI-Driven Hypothermia Risk Prediction, Parental Alerts, and Workflow Integration

**Key Idea**: Automated, non-contact IR scanning with individualized AI risk prediction, real-time parental alerts, and seamless clinical workflow integration enables safe, continuous neonatal monitoring.

**Paragraph**: Parental alerting (via app/SMS) now complements clinical alarms, improving engagement and response time [Sun 2020]. Seamless integration with EMRs and neonatal workflow systems guarantees data continuity and reduces staff burden. Adaptive AI thresholds reduce false positives by learning each neonate’s environmental and physiologic context.

**Approach**: Develop contactless IR with AI risk models, parental alerting, and EMR integration; pilot in neonatal wards, tracking outcomes and workflow efficiency.

**Key References**: [Chaudhury 2015]; [Ring 2012]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added parental alerts and workflow integration.
- Strengthens engagement, continuity of care, and efficiency.
