# Final Report: Idea 13

## Final ELO Score: 1507.2

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Pocket IR Scanner with AI-Assisted, Skin Tone-Adaptive Vein Mapping, AR Guidance, and Automated Procedure Documentation for Venous Access

**Key Idea**: An ultra-portable IR scanner with AI-driven, skin tone-adaptive vein mapping, AR overlays, and automated documentation improves venipuncture success and traceability across diverse populations.

**Paragraph**: Automated procedure documentation logs each attempt with anonymized images and outcomes, supporting quality assurance and training [Moridani 2020]. AR overlays guide users in real time, and AI models, trained for diverse skin types and anatomies, improve equity and procedural success.

**Approach**: Train AI on diverse datasets; develop AR overlays and automated documentation; test in clinical settings for success rate, equity, and quality improvement.

**Key References**: [Cuper 2013]; [Ring 2012]; [Vardasca 2019]; [Stoppa 2014]; [Moridani 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added automated documentation for QA and training.
- Strengthens traceability and continuous improvement.
