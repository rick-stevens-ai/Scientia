**Title**: IR Scanner with Advanced Automated Privacy-Filtering and Consent Management Algorithms for Ethical Mass Screening

**Key Idea**: Built-in advanced privacy and consent management algorithms obfuscate identifying features and manage user consent in IR scans, enabling ethical, transparent mass screening.

**Paragraph**: Privacy concerns restrict imaging in public spaces. Embedding advanced, automated algorithms that anonymize faces, sensitive features, and manage digital consent ensures ethical deployment. Transparent consent management and reviewable privacy logs further increase public trust and compliance.

**Approach**: Develop and validate privacy-preserving and consent management software; evaluate acceptability and compliance in public and clinical settings; assess impact on screening outcomes.

**Key References**: [Moridani 2020]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:  
- Added automated consent management and transparency features.  
- Strengthens ethical compliance and public trust.  
- No new citations needed.
