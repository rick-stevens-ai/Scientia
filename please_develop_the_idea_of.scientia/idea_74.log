**Title**: Low-Power, Solar/Hand-Cranked IR Scanner with AI-Assisted Local Analytics, Offline Data Sync, and Multilingual Voice Guidance for Off-Grid Rural Clinics

**Key Idea**: A solar/hand-powered, ultra-low-power IR scanner with AI analytics, offline batch sync, and multilingual voice guidance delivers robust diagnostics and record integration in off-grid settings.

**Paragraph**: To further address power and literacy barriers, a hand-crank option supplements solar charging, and multilingual voice prompts guide users through scanning and troubleshooting [Ashok 2017]. Offline analytics and batch uploads ensure autonomy and data integrity. The deviceâ€™s rugged, low-maintenance design is tailored for rural, resource-limited clinics.

**Approach**: Engineer solar/hand-crank powered device with AI, voice guidance, offline sync; test in rural/low-resource clinics assessing workflow, diagnostic accuracy, and user satisfaction.

**Key References**: [Sun 2020]; [Ashok 2017]; [Moridani 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added hand-crank charging and multilingual voice guidance.
- Rugged, low-maintenance, low-literacy design.
- Strengthens autonomy, accessibility, and sustainability.
