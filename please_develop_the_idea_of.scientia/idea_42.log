**Title**: Digital Twin for Personalized Health Surveillance Using Continuous Infrared Thermography Data

**Key Idea**: Creating a personalized digital twin that incorporates continuous IR thermography and other health data enables individualized baseline modeling and early anomaly detection.

**Paragraph**: Most medical screening is reactive and population-based. Building an individualized digital twin—a dynamic, computational model of a person’s physiology—using continuous IR thermography and other wearable data enables precise modeling of personal baselines and early detection of deviations indicative of illness or injury. This

**Approach**: supports proactive, precision health interventions and can be integrated with telemedicine for real-time risk assessment.

**Approach**: Develop a digital twin platform that ingests real-time IR and wearable health data; employ machine learning to establish personal baselines and flag anomalies; pilot with volunteers and assess efficacy in early illness detection.

**Summary of Refinements:**
- Many ideas were extended with AI-driven analytics, connectivity, automation, privacy controls, and integration with other health data streams.
- Simplification focused on user guidance, usability, and workflow integration.
- Synergies were exploited by combining wireless, cloud, and AI components.
- Weaknesses (privacy, usability, calibration) were directly addressed.
- All original citations preserved, with new ones added as relevant.

**Summary of New Ideas:**
- Introduced truly multi-modal, biosensor-integrated IR monitoring.
- Proposed digital twin modeling for personalized, predictive health surveillance—an unexplored angle in the initial set.

All ideas are now stronger, address real-world barriers, and are supported by robust literature.
