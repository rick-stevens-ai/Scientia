**Title**: Pocket IR Scanner with AI-Assisted, Skin Tone-Adaptive Vein Mapping and Augmented Reality Guidance for Venous Access

**Key Idea**: An ultra-portable IR scanner with AI-driven, skin tone-adaptive vein mapping and augmented reality (AR) overlays enhances venipuncture success, especially in challenging or diverse patient populations.

**Paragraph**: The device now uses AR overlays (via smartphone/tablet) to guide users in real time, and AI models are specifically trained for variable skin tones and pediatric/aged skin, improving equity and usability across demographics.

**Approach**: Train AI models on diverse skin datasets; integrate real-time AR overlays; test in clinical settings for success rate and user experience.

**Key References**: [Cuper 2013]; [Ring 2012]; [Vardasca 2019]; **[Stoppa 2014]** (AR interface, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added AR overlay guidance and expanded skin tone adaptation.
- Strengthens equity, usability, and procedural success.
