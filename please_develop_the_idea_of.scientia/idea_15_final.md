# Final Report: Idea 15

## Final ELO Score: 1504.9

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Modular, Specialty-Configurable IR Scanner Platform with Rapid Software-Based Reconfiguration, Open Interface Standards, and AI App Store

**Key Idea**: A modular IR scanner platform with open APIs, rapid software reconfiguration, and an AI app store enables dynamic adaptation and future-proofing across clinical specialties.

**Paragraph**: An AI app store allows third-party developers to create specialty modules (e.g., dermatology, oncology), expanding functionality and fostering an ecosystem of innovation [Sun 2020]. Open APIs enable seamless integration with telemedicine and analytics platforms, maximizing interoperability and long-term value.

**Approach**: Develop open hardware/software APIs and AI app store; pilot in multi-specialty clinics; evaluate adaptability, interoperability, user engagement, and ecosystem growth.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [Vardasca 2019]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added AI app store for third-party module expansion.
- Strengthens ecosystem adaptability and scalability.
