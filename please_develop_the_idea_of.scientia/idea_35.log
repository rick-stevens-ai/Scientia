**Title**: Modular, Specialty-Configurable IR Scanner Platform with Plug-and-Play Clinical Attachments

**Key Idea**: A modular IR scanner platform with plug-and-play specialty attachments enables rapid reconfiguration for diverse clinical applications, enhancing utility and cost-effectiveness.

**Paragraph**: Clinical disciplines demand different imaging features (e.g., resolution, field of view). A modular platform with easy-to-swap lenses, sensor arrays, and software modules supports rapid adaptation for dermatology, rheumatology, or other specialties, maximizing device utility and reducing costs for healthcare providers.

**Approach**: Design modular hardware and software with universal base units and specialty modules; validate performance across clinical scenarios; collect user feedback for iterative refinement.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [Vardasca 2019].

**Modifications**:  
- Emphasized plug-and-play hardware/software and universal base unit.  
- Strengthens adaptability and sustainability.  
- No new citations needed.
