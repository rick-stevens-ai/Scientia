**Title**: IR Scanner with Automated, Granular Privacy-Filtering and Dynamic Consent Management for Transparent Mass Screening

**Key Idea**: Advanced IR scanners with automated, granular privacy-filtering and dynamic, user-centric consent management enable ethical, transparent mass screening in public and clinical settings.

**Paragraph**: Granular privacy controls now allow users to specify consent for each scan and purpose, while automated algorithms obfuscate not only facial but also contextual identifiers. Dynamic consent dashboards provide participants with ongoing control and transparency.

**Approach**: Develop granular privacy/consent software; validate in public/clinical settings for compliance and participant satisfaction; monitor impact on screening rates and consent withdrawals.

**Key References**: [Moridani 2020]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Enhanced with granular, dynamic consent and contextual privacy filtering.
- Strengthens trust, transparency, and compliance.
