**Title**: Modular, Specialty-Configurable IR Scanner Platform with Rapid Software-Based Reconfiguration and Open Interface Standards

**Key Idea**: A modular IR scanner platform with rapid, software-based reconfiguration and open interface standards enables seamless adaptation and interoperability across clinical specialties.

**Paragraph**: New open software interfaces allow rapid switching between specialty modules (e.g., dermatology, rheumatology) and integration with third-party analytics or telemedicine solutions. This increases long-term value and future-proofs investments for health systems.

**Approach**: Develop modular hardware and open software APIs; test in multi-specialty clinics; evaluate adaptability, interoperability, and user satisfaction.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [Vardasca 2019]; **[Sun 2020]** (open standards, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added open interface standards and rapid software reconfiguration.
- Strengthens interoperability and future scalability.
