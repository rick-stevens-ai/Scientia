**Title**: Contactless, Automated Neonatal IR Scanning System with AI-Driven Hypothermia Risk Prediction for Continuous Monitoring

**Key Idea**: An automated, non-contact IR scanning system with AI-driven hypothermia risk prediction enables continuous, individualized neonatal temperature assessment in low-resource settings.

**Paragraph**: AI-driven risk prediction now adapts alarm thresholds to individual neonate baselines and environmental context, reducing false alarms and ensuring timely, targeted interventions. Data can be synchronized to neonatal health records for longitudinal tracking.

**Approach**: Develop contactless IR scanning with AI risk models; pilot in neonatal wards, tracking clinical outcomes and workflow impact; integrate with neonatal record systems.

**Key References**: [Chaudhury 2015]; [Ring 2012]; **[Sun 2020]** (AI risk analytics, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added AI-driven, individualized risk prediction and health record integration.
- Strengthens precision and care continuity.
