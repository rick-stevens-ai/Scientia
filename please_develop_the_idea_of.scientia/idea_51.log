**Title**: Low-Power, Solar-Charged IR Scanner with AI-Assisted Local Analytics and Offline Data Synchronization for Off-Grid Rural Clinics

**Key Idea**: A solar-rechargeable, ultra-low-power IR scanner with AI-assisted, offline analytics and batch data upload provides autonomous diagnostics and seamless record synchronization in off-grid healthcare settings.

**Paragraph**: The device now features onboard AI for more accurate, context-aware triage and supports batch data uploading when connectivity is available. This ensures that rural clinics can deliver advanced diagnostics autonomously and still integrate with health systems as needed, maximizing both independence and interoperability.

**Approach**: Engineer a solar-powered device with AI analytics and offline data storage; implement batch upload protocols; test in rural clinics, assessing workflow and diagnostic accuracy.

**Key References**: [Sun 2020]; [Ashok 2017]; **[Moridani 2020]** (offline analytics, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added AI-assisted offline analytics and batch synchronization.
- Strengthens autonomy and data integrity.
