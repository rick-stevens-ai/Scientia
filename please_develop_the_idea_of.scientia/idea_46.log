**Title**: AI-Enhanced Handheld IR Scanner with Personalized Injury Profiling and Adaptive User Guidance for Musculoskeletal Assessment

**Key Idea**: A portable IR scanner featuring AI-driven personalized injury profiling and adaptive, real-time user guidance optimizes detection and classification of musculoskeletal injuries.

**Paragraph**: Musculoskeletal injuries can vary widely between individuals. Enhanced AI algorithms now use prior patient scans or population data to personalize interpretation, while adaptive prompts respond dynamically to user actions, improving both image quality and diagnostic relevance. This

**Approach**: empowers frontline providers and supports self-assessment in athletic or remote settings.

**Approach**: Develop personalized AI models using patient-specific or population data; refine adaptive guidance features; test in clinical and athletic environments, measuring accuracy and user satisfaction.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [Vardasca 2019]; **[Sun 2020]** (for personalization, new).

**Modifications**:
- Introduced personalized injury profiling using historical/contextual data.
- Adaptive real-time prompts enhance scan quality.
- Strengthens individualized care and diagnostic precision.
- New citation for AI personalization.
