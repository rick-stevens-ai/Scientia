**Title**: Low-Power, Solar-Charged IR Scanner with Local Data Analysis for Off-Grid Rural Clinics

**Key Idea**: A solar-rechargeable, ultra-low-power IR scanner with on-device analytics provides sustainable, autonomous body scanning and basic diagnostics in off-grid healthcare settings.

**Paragraph**: Power and connectivity limitations in rural clinics hinder diagnostics. A rugged, solar-powered IR scanner with on-device analytic capability can perform basic triage (fever, burns, etc.) and decision support without relying on external power or connectivity, ensuring continuous care delivery.

**Approach**: Engineer a solar-powered device with optimized power management and embedded analytics; field-test in off-grid clinics; evaluate diagnostic reliability and user acceptability.

**Key References**: [Sun 2020]; [Ashok 2017].

**Modifications**:  
- Added on-device analytics for autonomy.  
- Strengthens independence from network connectivity.  
- No new citations needed.
