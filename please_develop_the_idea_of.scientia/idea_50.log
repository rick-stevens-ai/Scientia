**Title**: Textile-Integrated IR Sensing Garments with Adaptive Haptic and Visual Feedback for Continuous, Multi-Zone Health Monitoring

**Key Idea**: Garments embedded with distributed IR sensors and adaptive haptic/visual feedback modules provide continuous, multi-zone temperature mapping and early anomaly warning for proactive health monitoring.

**Paragraph**: The garment now supports multi-zone sensing (e.g., torso, limbs) and offers both haptic (vibration) and visual (LED/app) feedback, enhancing user awareness and compliance. Cloud connectivity enables optional data sharing with clinicians, supporting remote monitoring for at-risk populations such as the elderly or athletes.

**Approach**: Develop multi-zone sensor-embedded textiles with integrated haptic/visual feedback; field-test for comfort, durability, and clinical utility; implement cloud data sharing and clinician dashboards.

**Key References**: [Stoppa 2014]; [Tognetti 2012]; **[Sun 2020]** (for remote monitoring, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added multi-zone sensing, visual feedback, and optional clinician integration.
- Strengthens comprehensiveness and remote care.
