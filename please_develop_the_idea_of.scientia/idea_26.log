**Title**: Autonomous Drone-Deployed IR Scanners with Real-Time AI Triage for Remote Patient Assessment

**Key Idea**: Lightweight IR scanners on drones, guided by AI, autonomously perform remote body temperature and injury assessment, triaging individuals and transmitting prioritized data to clinicians.

**Paragraph**: Inaccessibility due to disasters or geography impedes patient assessment. Equipping drones with IR scanners and on-board AI allows autonomous identification and prioritization of individuals with fever or trauma, transmitting real-time, triaged data to remote clinicians for targeted intervention.

**Approach**: Integrate IR cameras and edge AI into drone platforms; develop autonomous triage algorithms; pilot in simulated disasters; evaluate triage accuracy and time-to-intervention metrics.

**Key References**: [Bendezu 2019]; [Mercer 2015]; **[Vardasca 2019]** (AI in triage, new).

**Modifications**:  
- Added autonomous AI triage on drone.  
- Strengthens speed, prioritization, and data value.  
- New citation for AI triage.
