## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Connected Ultra-Portable IR Scanner with AI-Driven Longitudinal Trend Analysis, Personalized Alerts, and Behavioral Adherence Coaching for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Prevention

**Key Idea**: A pocket-sized, connected IR scanner with longitudinal AI trend analysis, personalized alerts, and real-time adherence coaching proactively prevents diabetic foot ulcers at home.

**Paragraph**: To address behavioral barriers, the scanner now features real-time adherence coaching, reminding users of scan routines and providing motivational feedback. AI models personalize risk alerts and generate reports for clinicians, linking with EMRs for targeted interventions. This holistic

**Approach**: reduces complications and improves self-management.

**Approach**: Develop scanner/app with personalized analytics, adherence coaching, and EMR integration; conduct longitudinal studies in diabetic populations; assess ulcer incidence, adherence, and healthcare utilization.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [van Netten 2014]; [Sun 2020]; **[Heikenfeld 2018]** (adherence coaching, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added adherence coaching to maximize preventive impact.
- EMR integration for clinical follow-up.
- New citation for behavioral nudges.
- Strengthens patient engagement and preventive efficacy.
