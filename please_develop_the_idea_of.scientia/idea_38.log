**Title**: Low-Cost, Rugged IR Scanner with AI-Based Animal Health Analytics for Veterinary and Zoonotic Disease Surveillance

**Key Idea**: An affordable, rugged IR scanner with AI-based animal health analytics supports rapid, non-invasive disease surveillance in animals, aiding early zoonotic outbreak detection.

**Paragraph**: Animal health surveillance is critical for preventing zoonotic outbreaks affecting humans. Adding AI-driven analytics for fever and injury detection in diverse species increases accuracy and usability for non-specialist users, enhancing field deployment and early response in agricultural and wildlife settings.

**Approach**: Adapt scanner hardware and software for multi-species use; train AI on animal IR datasets; field test with livestock and pets; validate findings against laboratory diagnoses.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [Moridani 2020]; **[Vardasca 2019]** (AI analytics, new).

**Modifications**:  
- Added AI-driven animal health analytics.  
- Strengthens diagnostic accuracy and usability.  
- New citation for AI analytics.
