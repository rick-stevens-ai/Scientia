**Title**: Integration of Infrared Thermography with Wearable Biosensors for Multi-Modal Health Monitoring

**Key Idea**: Combining infrared thermography with wearable biosensors (e.g., heart rate, SpO2, sweat analytes) enables comprehensive, multi-modal early detection of infection or systemic illness.

**Paragraph**: While IR thermography excels at detecting external thermal anomalies, many conditions also manifest as changes in physiological signals such as heart rate variability, oxygen saturation, or sweat biochemistry. Integrating IR-sensing patches or garments with biosensors enables synergistic, multi-modal monitoring, increasing sensitivity and specificity for early infection or systemic illness detection. This

**Approach**: provides a holistic real-time health profile, improving predictive analytics and intervention timing.

**Approach**: Develop integrated prototypes combining IR sensors and biosensors on a single wearable platform; design data fusion algorithms for anomaly detection; pilot in high-risk populations (e.g., elderly, immunocompromised); compare detection accuracy to single-modality devices.
