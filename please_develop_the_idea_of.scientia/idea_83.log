**Title**: Low-Cost, Rugged IR Scanner with Multi-Species AI, Zoonotic Early Warning, and Public Health Database Integration for Veterinary and Wildlife Surveillance

**Key Idea**: An affordable IR scanner with multi-species AI analytics, zoonotic outbreak warnings, and public health database integration enables robust animal health and outbreak surveillance in the field.

**Paragraph**: Direct integration with national and international animal health databases (e.g., OIE/WHO) supports rapid reporting and coordinated response to emerging zoonoses [Moridani 2020]. Multi-species AI models and outbreak alerts optimize resource allocation in agriculture, wildlife, and conservation.

**Approach**: Develop multi-species AI models, outbreak alert integration, and database interfaces; field-test in animal populations and outbreak simulations.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [Moridani 2020]; [Vardasca 2019].

**Modifications**:
- Added direct public health database integration.
- Strengthens surveillance, reporting, and actionability.
