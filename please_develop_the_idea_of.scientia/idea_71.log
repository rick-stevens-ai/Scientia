**Title**: Autonomous Drone-Deployed IR Scanners with Edge AI Triage, Secure Multi-Agency Data Sharing, and Geospatial Mapping for Remote Patient Assessment

**Key Idea**: Drone-mounted IR scanners with edge AI triage, secure multi-agency sharing, and real-time geospatial mapping autonomously assess and prioritize patients in inaccessible areas for coordinated emergency response.

**Paragraph**: Geospatial mapping overlays IR triage data onto real-time maps, enabling command centers to visualize patient locations and severity, optimizing resource deployment [Bendezu 2019]. Data is encrypted and relayed to multiple agencies, supporting coordinated multi-team response, while maintaining privacy. Edge AI ensures only actionable data is transmitted, conserving bandwidth and reducing response latency.

**Approach**: Integrate IR/edge AI modules and geospatial mapping on drones; implement secure, multi-channel, encrypted data relay; conduct disaster simulations measuring triage accuracy, response time, and coordination efficiency.

**Key References**: [Bendezu 2019]; [Mercer 2015]; [Vardasca 2019]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added geospatial mapping for real-time situational awareness.
- Enhanced bandwidth efficiency.
- Strengthens response coordination and operational effectiveness.
