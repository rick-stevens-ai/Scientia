# Final Report: Idea 21

## Final ELO Score: 1502.1

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Modular, Open-Source IR Imaging Kit for Citizen Science, Education, and Grassroots Epidemiology

**Key Idea**: An affordable, modular, open-source IR imaging kit with educational materials and community analytics tools democratizes IR health research, enabling citizen science and educational outreach.

**Paragraph**: Many communities and schools lack access to advanced IR imaging for health, environmental, or animal studies. A modular, open-source kit—with detailed instructions, curriculum guides, and open community analytics platform—enables students, teachers, and citizen scientists to collect, analyze, and share IR data for public health, environmental monitoring, or research. Open hardware/software fosters innovation and data transparency, while community analytics tools support grassroots epidemiology and collaborative discovery [Bruynseels 2018], [Heikenfeld 2018].

**Approach**: Design modular, low-cost IR kits with open documentation and software; develop educational and analytics resources; pilot in educational and community settings, measuring engagement, knowledge gains, and data contributions.
