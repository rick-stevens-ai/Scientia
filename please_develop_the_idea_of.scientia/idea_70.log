**Title**: Disposable, Color-Changing Infrared Strip with NFC/Bluetooth Digital Logging, Child-Friendly Design, and Automated Epidemiological Reporting

**Key Idea**: A single-use, colorimetric IR strip with NFC/Bluetooth digital logging, child-friendly design features, and automated public health reporting enables rapid, hygienic screening and robust data capture in pediatric and mass settings.

**Paragraph**: Addressing both engagement and scalability, the strip now features child-friendly graphics to reduce anxiety and improve compliance [Heikenfeld 2018]. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is included alongside NFC for flexible digital logging. Automated, anonymized reporting to public health authorities streamlines epidemiological surveillance while maintaining privacy. Visual cues remain easy to interpret, ensuring inclusivity for non-literate users.

**Approach**: Develop IR-sensitive strips with NFC/BLE chips and engaging child-friendly design; companion app for logging and reporting; field-test in pediatric clinics and schools for accuracy, usability, engagement, and reporting efficiency.

**Key References**: [Ng 2009]; [Sund-Levander 2002]; [Stoppa 2014]; [Moridani 2020]; **[Heikenfeld 2018]** (child engagement, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added BLE for broader device compatibility.
- Child-friendly design features.
- Automated public health reporting.
- New citation for engagement.
- Strengthens compliance, inclusivity, and surveillance.
