**Title**: Multi-Spectral Portable IR Scanner with Deep Learning Tissue Differentiation, Interactive Decision Support, and Explainable AI Visualization

**Key Idea**: A portable, multi-spectral IR scanner with deep learning, interactive clinical support, and explainable AI visualization enables high-precision, transparent tissue pathology detection at the point of care.

**Paragraph**: Explainable AI modules now visualize the regions and features driving diagnostic decisions, increasing clinical trust and supporting regulatory approval [Sun 2020]. Interactive decision support offers differential diagnoses and recommended next steps, while deep learning models trained on diverse datasets maximize tissue classification accuracy.

**Approach**: Develop multi-spectral hardware, deep learning, and explainable AI visualization; validate in point-of-care trials for accuracy, workflow impact, and clinician trust.

**Key References**: [Vardasca 2019]; [Ring 2012]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added explainable AI visualization for transparency.
- Strengthens clinician trust and regulatory acceptability.
