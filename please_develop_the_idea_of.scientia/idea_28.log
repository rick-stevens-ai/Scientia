**Title**: Textile-Integrated IR Sensing Garments with Adaptive Feedback for Continuous Health Monitoring

**Key Idea**: Clothing with distributed IR sensors and adaptive feedback (e.g., haptic or mobile alerts) provides continuous, unobtrusive body temperature mapping and early warning for health anomalies.

**Paragraph**: Integrating miniaturized IR sensors into garments enables seamless, continuous health monitoring. Adding real-time adaptive feedback—such as haptic vibration or app notifications—alerts users to abnormal temperature trends, supporting early intervention for fever, inflammation, or circulatory issues without user initiation.

**Approach**: Develop sensor-embedded fabrics with integrated feedback modules; assess durability, comfort, and feedback responsiveness in ambulatory monitoring trials.

**Key References**: [Stoppa 2014]; [Tognetti 2012].

**Modifications**:  
- Added adaptive feedback to alert users in real time.  
- Strengthens user awareness and intervention.  
- No new citations needed.
