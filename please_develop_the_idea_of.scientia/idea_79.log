**Title**: IR Scanner with Automated, Granular Privacy-Filtering, Dynamic Consent Dashboards, and Audit Transparency for Ethical Mass Screening

**Key Idea**: Advanced IR scanners with automated, contextual privacy filtering, dynamic consent dashboards, and transparent audit logs enable ethical, trustworthy mass screening.

**Paragraph**: Transparent audit logs record all data access and processing events, viewable by participants or regulators, further building trust [Sun 2020]. Context-aware privacy filtering obscures both facial and environmental identifiers, while dynamic consent dashboards empower ongoing user control.

**Approach**: Develop privacy/consent/audit software; validate in public/clinical settings; monitor impact on trust, compliance, and auditability.

**Key References**: [Moridani 2020]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added transparent audit logs for accountability.
- Strengthens trust, transparency, and regulatory oversight.
