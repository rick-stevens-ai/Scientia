**Title**: Autonomous Drone-Deployed IR Scanners with Edge AI Triage and Secure Multi-Agency Data Relay for Remote Patient Assessment

**Key Idea**: Lightweight IR scanners on drones, equipped with edge AI triage and secure, multi-agency data relay, autonomously assess and prioritize patients in inaccessible areas, supporting coordinated emergency response.

**Paragraph**: Disaster response requires not just triage but rapid, secure coordination among multiple agencies. The system now features edge AI that performs preliminary triage onboard, and secure data relay protocols that transmit findings to multiple stakeholders (e.g., medics, rescue teams) for coordinated response, while maintaining patient privacy.

**Approach**: Integrate IR cameras and edge AI onto drones; implement secure, multi-channel data relay; pilot in simulated disasters with real-time coordination among agencies.

**Key References**: [Bendezu 2019]; [Mercer 2015]; [Vardasca 2019]; **[Sun 2020]** (multi-agency data, new).

**Modifications**:
- Edge AI for onboard triage and secure, multi-agency data sharing.
- Strengthens coordination, privacy, and response efficiency.
- New citation for multi-agency data relay.
