**Title**: Secure, Privacy-Preserving Cloud-Connected IR Scanners with Population Analytics, Consent Dashboards, and Cross-Jurisdiction Compliance for Surveillance

**Key Idea**: Portable IR scanners with secure cloud connectivity, real-time population analytics, dynamic consent management, and cross-jurisdiction privacy compliance enable trusted, large-scale temperature surveillance.

**Paragraph**: The platform now features a user-facing consent dashboard and region-aware privacy modules that adapt to local data regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) [Sun 2020]. APIs enable integration with diverse health IT systems, and real-time analytics flag epidemiological anomalies, supporting rapid, ethical public health intervention.

**Approach**: Implement modular consent/privacy software; validate in clinics and public hubs; measure impact on surveillance, trust, and compliance.

**Key References**: [Sun 2020]; [Moridani 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added dynamic consent dashboard and cross-jurisdiction compliance.
- Strengthens ethical adoption and legal robustness.
