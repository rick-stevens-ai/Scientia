**Title**: Contactless, Automated Neonatal IR Scanning System for Continuous Hypothermia Risk Detection

**Key Idea**: An automated, non-contact IR scanning system with continuous monitoring capability enables rapid, frequent neonatal body temperature assessments, reducing hypothermia-related mortality in low-resource settings.

**Paragraph**: Neonatal hypothermia remains a major cause of infant mortality, especially in resource-limited settings. A contactless, automated IR system that can continuously or periodically scan multiple infants without direct handling supports timely warming interventions and reduces infection risk, improving survival rates.

**Approach**: Develop an automated IR scanning system with adjustable scanning intervals; field test in maternity wards; compare outcomes and workflow integration to standard thermometry.

**Key References**: [Chaudhury 2015]; [Ring 2012].

**Modifications**:  
- Added automation and continuous monitoring.  
- Strengthens utility for high-risk, high-volume wards.  
- No new citations needed.
