# Final Report: Idea 2

## Final ELO Score: 1503.9

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: AI-Powered Smartphone-Integrated Multi-Region Infrared Scanner with Augmented Reality Guidance and On-Device Privacy Controls for Home and Remote Diagnostics

**Key Idea**: A compact, multi-region IR sensor for smartphones with adaptive AI, real-time AR guidance, and on-device privacy controls democratizes accurate diagnostics in home and low-resource environments.

**Paragraph**: Building further on usability, the system now overlays AR visual guides (using the phone’s camera) to assist users in optimal scan placement and angle, reducing artifacts and improving acquisition consistency [Stoppa 2014]. On-device preprocessing anonymizes sensitive data before optional cloud upload, increasing privacy and reducing network dependence. These enhancements, combined with context-aware AI and optional telemedicine integration, empower laypersons and minimally trained health workers to perform reliable fever, inflammation, and vascular assessments, expanding access and equity.

**Approach**: Develop a multi-region IR module and app with AI-driven AR overlays and on-device anonymization; integrate optional secure cloud review; validate in diverse, real-world settings for usability, accuracy, and privacy compliance.

**Key References**: [Ng 2009]; [Sun 2020]; [Vardasca 2019]; [Stoppa 2014]; **[Moridani 2020]** (on-device privacy, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added AR visual overlays for real-time, intuitive user guidance.
- Introduced on-device privacy/anonymization prior to cloud upload.
- New citation for privacy.
- Strengthens acquisition reliability, user experience, and privacy.
