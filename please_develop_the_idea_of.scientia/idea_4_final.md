# Final Report: Idea 4

## Final ELO Score: 1503.6

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: AI-Enhanced Handheld IR Scanner with Personalized Injury Profiling, Adaptive User Guidance, and Outcome Feedback Loop for Musculoskeletal Assessment

**Key Idea**: A portable IR scanner with AI-driven personalized injury profiling, adaptive user prompts, and integrated outcome feedback enables precision musculoskeletal diagnostics and continuous model improvement.

**Paragraph**: In addition to personalized AI models, the system now incorporates an outcome feedback loop, where results (diagnosis/clinical outcome) are securely fed back into the system to refine and personalize algorithms further [Sun 2020]. Adaptive prompts adjust to user skill level and environmental context, supporting both clinicians and lay users. This closed-loop learning empowers both self-assessment and professional care, accelerating diagnosis and recovery in diverse environments.

**Approach**: Develop personalized AI models with secure outcome feedback; refine adaptive guidance for variable user skill levels; trial in clinical and sports/remote settings, measuring diagnostic precision and user improvement over time.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [Vardasca 2019]; [Sun 2020]; **[Heikenfeld 2018]** (closed-loop feedback, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added secure outcome feedback loop for continuous AI improvement.
- Adaptive prompts tailored to user skill and context.
- New citation for feedback-driven learning.
- Strengthens personalization, accuracy, and system adaptability.
