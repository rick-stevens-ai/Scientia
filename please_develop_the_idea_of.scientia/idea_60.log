**Title**: Low-Cost, Rugged IR Scanner with Multi-Species AI Analytics and Zoonotic Outbreak Early Warning for Veterinary Field Use

**Key Idea**: An affordable, rugged IR scanner with multi-species AI analytics and integrated zoonotic outbreak early warning supports non-invasive animal health monitoring in field environments.

**Paragraph**: Early warning algorithms now cross-reference animal IR findings with local outbreak data, flagging potential zoonotic threats. The device supports remote sync with veterinary/public health databases, enhancing surveillance and rapid response in agricultural and wildlife contexts.

**Approach**: Train multi-species AI models; develop outbreak early warning integration; field-test in diverse animal populations and outbreak simulations.

**Key References**: [Ring 2012]; [Moridani 2020]; [Vardasca 2019].

**Modifications**:
- Added zoonotic early warning and public health integration.
- Strengthens surveillance and rapid outbreak response.
