**Title**: AI-Powered Smartphone-Integrated Multi-Region Infrared Scanner with User-Adaptive Guidance for Home and Remote Diagnostics

**Key Idea**: Attaching a compact, multi-region IR sensor module to smartphones, combined with adaptive AI-driven user guidance and analytics, democratizes accurate fever, inflammation, and vascular diagnostics in home and low-resource settings.

**Paragraph**: The combination of widespread smartphone adoption and adaptive AI transforms IR diagnostics for lay users. The system incorporates real-time, context-aware guidance to optimize scan regions and technique, reducing user error. Secure cloud integration allows for optional, anonymized expert review or telemedicine linkage, further increasing utility, especially for populations with limited clinical access.

**Approach**: Build a multi-region IR module and app with adaptive, AI-powered acquisition/interpretation; integrate optional cloud-based expert review; validate performance against gold-standard devices in diverse, real-world scenarios.

**Key References**: [Ng 2009]; [Sun 2020]; [Vardasca 2019]; **[Stoppa 2014]** (user interface, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added multi-region scanning and context-aware, adaptive AI guidance.
- Optional secure cloud review for remote expert input.
- Strengthens usability, accuracy, and scalability.
- New citation for user interface design.
