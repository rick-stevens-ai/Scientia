**Title**: Adaptive, Self-Calibrating Wearable Smart Infrared Thermographic Patch with Predictive Analytics, Multimodal Sensing, and Secure Remote Alert System for Real-Time Wound Monitoring

**Key Idea**: A flexible, adhesive patch with miniaturized IR and complementary biosensors, self-calibration, adaptive machine learning, and privacy-preserving remote alerting enables individualized, continuous wound monitoring and early infection detection.

**Paragraph**: While temperature anomalies are key early indicators of wound infection, integrating additional biosensing modalities (e.g., local pH, moisture, or impedance) with IR thermography can significantly enhance specificity and reduce false alarms [Heikenfeld 2018], [Stoppa 2014]. Self-calibration routines account for environmental and physiological drift, further improving accuracy. Enhanced predictive analytics fuse these data streams for robust, individualized detection. Secure, encrypted transmission and dynamic user-controlled privacy settings ensure regulatory compliance and user trust, making the patch suitable for both home and clinical use, including vulnerable and remote populations [Sun 2020], [Moridani 2020].

**Approach**: Develop biocompatible, flexible patches with microbolometer arrays and auxiliary biosensors; implement self-calibration algorithms and multimodal, adaptive analytics; ensure encrypted, user-controlled wireless data transfer; validate in clinical pilots for accuracy, specificity, and user satisfaction.

**Key References**: [Krumholz 2017]; [Ring 2012]; [Stoppa 2014]; [Sun 2020]; **[Heikenfeld 2018]** (multimodal sensing, new); [Moridani 2020] (privacy, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added multimodal biosensors (e.g., pH, moisture) to increase specificity.
- Included self-calibration to address sensor/environmental drift.
- Reinforced privacy compliance with dynamic settings.
- New citations for multimodal sensing and privacy.
- Strengthens detection reliability and regulatory readiness.
