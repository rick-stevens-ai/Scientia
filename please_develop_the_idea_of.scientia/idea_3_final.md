# Final Report: Idea 3

## Final ELO Score: 1500.1

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Foldable, Ruggedized IR Scanner with On-Device Prioritization, Cloud-Enabled Remote Consultation, and Multi-Agency Data Interoperability for Field Emergencies

**Key Idea**: A rugged, foldable IR scanner with real-time triage analytics, modular cloud workflows, and standards-based multi-agency data sharing streamlines trauma assessment and coordinated response in emergencies.

**Paragraph**: To maximize field deployability, the scanner now supports standards-based data formats (FHIR, HL7), enabling seamless interoperability with EMS, hospital, and government response platforms [Sun 2020]. On-device analytics prioritize critical cases for immediate attention, while modular cloud workflows enable secure, multidisciplinary consultation. Improved battery management and rapid deployment mechanisms (e.g., auto-unfold, quick-start) further enhance operational readiness and efficiency.

**Approach**: Engineer rugged, foldable hardware with on-device prioritization and health IT standards compliance; test multi-agency workflows in simulated mass-casualty scenarios; assess impact on triage speed, accuracy, and inter-agency coordination.

**Key References**: [Mercer 2015]; [Tognarelli 2015]; [Sun 2020]; **[Moridani 2020]** (interoperability, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added health IT standards (FHIR/HL7) for interoperability.
- Enhanced deployment speed (auto-unfold, quick-start).
- New citation for interoperability.
- Strengthens cross-agency collaboration and rapid response.
