# Final Report: Idea 10

## Final ELO Score: 1499.9

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Multiplexed Wide-Angle IR Scanner with Real-Time Anomaly Detection, Dynamic Queue Management, and Contactless Access Control for Mass Screening

**Key Idea**: An array-based, wide-angle IR scanner with automated anomaly detection, dynamic queue management, and integrated contactless access control optimizes throughput and infection control in high-volume settings.

**Paragraph**: The system now includes contactless access control (e.g., entry turnstiles) linked to screening outcomes, automating flow and minimizing human contact. Dynamic queue algorithms adapt to real-time scanning loads, while privacy-preserving reporting ensures compliance and data security—critical for outbreak control in airports, schools, and events [Ng 2009], [Sun 2020].

**Approach**: Develop wide-angle IR arrays, queue/access control algorithms; validate in simulated high-traffic environments; measure throughput, screening accuracy, and compliance.

**Key References**: [Moridani 2020]; [Ng 2009]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added integrated contactless access control.
- Strengthens infection control and operational automation.
