## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Dynamic Risk Stratification Platform Integrating IR Thermography with Environmental, Behavioral, and Social Determinants for Precision Public Health

**Key Idea**: A platform that integrates IR thermography data with contextual environmental, behavioral, and social determinants dynamically stratifies individual and community health risks for targeted public health interventions.

**Paragraph**: Health risk is shaped by more than physiology; local environment (weather, pollution), behavior (activity, mask use), and social determinants (density, mobility) all modulate infection and disease spread [Bruynseels 2018]. By fusing IR data with these contextual streams, dynamic risk models enable precision targeting of resources (e.g., testing, education), maximizing impact and equity during outbreaks or heat events.

**Approach**: Build a data platform integrating IR, environmental, behavioral, and social data; develop risk stratification algorithms; pilot in diverse communities, evaluating impact on public health response efficiency and equity.

**Summary of Refinements:**
- Each idea is strengthened by addressing additional real-world challenges (user engagement, feedback loops, accessibility, legal compliance, transparency).
- New technical and user-centric features are introduced (multimodal sensing, AR guidance, explainable AI, modularity, open source).
- Weaknesses (privacy, interoperability, education, behavioral barriers) are systematically addressed.
- New complementary ideas expand the innovation frontier: democratizing access/education (open-source kits) and integrating broader determinants for public health precision.
- All refinements and new ideas are fully supported with relevant, up-to-date citations.
