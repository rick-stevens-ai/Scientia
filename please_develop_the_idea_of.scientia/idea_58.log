**Title**: IR Scanner with Multimodal Voice, Gesture, and Eye-Tracking Controls for Universal Accessibility and Sterile Environments

**Key Idea**: Integrating voice, gesture, and eye-tracking controls into portable IR scanners maximizes accessibility for clinicians and users with disabilities, and supports sterile, hands-free operation.

**Paragraph**: Eye-tracking provides an additional hands-free modality, especially useful for those with speech or motor impairments or in sterile environments. Combined multimodal control increases inclusivity and reduces error rates in diverse clinical scenarios.

**Approach**: Implement and validate multimodal controls including eye-tracking; conduct usability and error rate studies in clinical and disability settings; assess workflow impact.

**Key References**: [Stoppa 2014]; [Sun 2020]; **[Heikenfeld 2018]** (for accessibility, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added eye-tracking as a third control modality.
- Strengthens universal accessibility and usability.
