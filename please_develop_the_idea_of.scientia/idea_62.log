**Title**: Multi-Spectral Portable IR Scanner with Deep Learning-Based Tissue Pathology Differentiation and Interactive Clinical Decision Support

**Key Idea**: A portable, multi-spectral IR scanner with deep learning-based tissue differentiation and interactive decision support enables real-time, high-precision pathology detection at the point of care.

**Paragraph**: Interactive decision support now provides clinicians with differential diagnoses and next-step recommendations, increasing clinical relevance and workflow efficiency. Deep learning models, trained on diverse, labeled datasets, improve tissue classification accuracy for tumors, inflammation, and vascular changes.

**Approach**: Develop multi-spectral hardware and deep learning analytics; integrate interactive decision support; validate in point-of-care trials for diagnostic accuracy and workflow impact.

**Key References**: [Vardasca 2019]; [Ring 2012]; **[Sun 2020]** (interactive support, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added interactive decision support and deep learning models.
- Strengthens specificity, usability, and clinical workflow integration.
