# Final Report: Idea 17

## Final ELO Score: 1503.0

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Self-Calibrating IR Scanner with Context-Aware Environmental Sensing, Proactive User Education, and Adaptive Error Correction for Reliable Home Monitoring

**Key Idea**: Automated self-calibration, context-aware environmental sensing, proactive user education, and adaptive error correction maximize scan reliability and user trust in home settings.

**Paragraph**: Adaptive error correction algorithms now prompt users to re-scan or adjust technique when anomalies are detected, further reducing user error and ensuring high-quality results. Educational modules adapt to user learning curves, reinforcing proper technique and engagement.

**Approach**: Develop adaptive error correction and educational modules; test with lay users in diverse home environments; measure scan quality, user engagement, and learning retention.

**Key References**: [Ng 2009]; [Vardasca 2019]; **[Heikenfeld 2018]** (adaptive learning, new).

**Modifications**:
- Added adaptive error correction and learning modules.
- Strengthens reliability, user empowerment, and education.
