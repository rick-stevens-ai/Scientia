**Title**: Foldable, Ruggedized IR Scanner with Real-Time Cloud Analytics and Remote Consultation Workflow for Emergency Response

**Key Idea**: A foldable, rugged IR scanner with embedded real-time analytics and seamless cloud integration enables rapid trauma assessment and expert consultation in field emergencies.

**Paragraph**: In disaster settings, rapid triage and access to expertise are critical. The device now features on-device, real-time analytics to prioritize cases before upload, and a streamlined remote consultation workflow with secure data sharing for multidisciplinary teams. Enhanced battery management allows extended field use, and modular software supports integration with emergency response platforms, optimizing both speed and coordination.

**Approach**: Engineer a rugged, foldable device with real-time analytics and modular cloud connectivity; simulate mass-casualty field use; measure impact on triage accuracy, speed, and remote team effectiveness.

**Key References**: [Mercer 2015]; [Tognarelli 2015]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:
- Added on-device triage analytics and improved remote workflow.
- Enhanced battery management for field use.
- Strengthens speed, prioritization, and real-world deployment.
