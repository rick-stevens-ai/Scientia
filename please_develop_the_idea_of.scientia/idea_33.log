**Title**: Pocket IR Scanner with AI-Assisted Vein Mapping for Rapid, Inclusive Venous Access Localization

**Key Idea**: An ultra-portable IR scanner with AI-driven, real-time vein detection improves venipuncture success, especially in challenging cases and diverse skin types.

**Paragraph**: Locating veins for IV access is difficult in children, obese, or dark-skinned patients. Integrating AI for real-time vein mapping and guidance enhances visualization, reduces failure rates, and improves patient experience. This solution supports equitable care across diverse populations and skill levels.

**Approach**: Optimize IR imaging for superficial vein detection; train AI models on multi-ethnic datasets; test usability and success rates versus standard aids.

**Key References**: [Cuper 2013]; [Ring 2012]; **[Vardasca 2019]** (AI enhancement, new).

**Modifications**:  
- Added AI-driven real-time mapping and multi-ethnic validation.  
- Strengthens equity and usability.  
- New citation for AI in imaging.
