**Title**: Adaptive Wearable Smart Infrared Thermographic Patch with Predictive Analytics and Secure Remote Alert System for Real-Time Wound Monitoring

**Key Idea**: A flexible, adhesive patch with miniaturized IR sensors, secure wireless connectivity, and onboard predictive analytics enables continuous, adaptive wound monitoring and automatic, privacy-preserving alerts to caregivers for early detection of infection.

**Paragraph**: Early intervention in wound management is critical, as temperature anomalies often precede visible signs of infection. The refined patch not only tracks real-time temperature changes but integrates predictive machine learning models that adapt to individual baselines, improving early detection accuracy. Secure, encrypted wireless transmission and user-controlled privacy settings ensure safe, compliant remote monitoring, making the system suitable for both home and clinical use, especially in vulnerable or remote populations.

**Approach**: Develop biocompatible, flexible patches with microbolometer arrays, predictive analytics software, and secure wireless modules; implement encrypted data transfer and customizable privacy controls; validate sensitivity, specificity, and usability in clinical pilot studies.

**Key References**: [Krumholz 2017]; [Ring 2012]; [Stoppa 2014]; **[Sun 2020]** (for digital health privacy, new).

**Modifications**:
- Enhanced with adaptive predictive analytics for individualized detection.
- Added secure, privacy-preserving data transmission and user-controlled privacy settings.
- Preserves core wireless/analytic features; new citation for digital health privacy.
- Strengthens detection accuracy, user trust, and regulatory compliance.
