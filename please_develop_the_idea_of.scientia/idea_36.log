**Title**: IR Scanner with Multimodal Voice and Touchless Gesture Controls for Universal Accessibility

**Key Idea**: Integrating voice and gesture controls into portable IR scanners enhances usability for clinicians with limited dexterity, in sterile environments, and for users with disabilities.

**Paragraph**: Hands-free operation reduces contamination risks and supports accessibility for users with physical disabilities. Combining voice-activated controls (for image capture, analysis, and storage) with intuitive gesture recognition (e.g., waving to initiate scan) expands usability across various environments, including surgery and field care.

**Approach**: Implement and validate multimodal (voice and gesture) user interfaces; conduct usability studies with clinicians and users with disabilities; assess workflow integration and error rates.

**Key References**: [Stoppa 2014]; [Sun 2020].

**Modifications**:  
- Added touchless gesture controls to voice interface.  
- Strengthens universal accessibility.  
- No new citations needed.
