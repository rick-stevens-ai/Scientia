**Title**: Disposable, Color-Changing Infrared Strip for Rapid, Hygienic Pediatric and Mass Fever Screening

**Key Idea**: A single-use, colorimetric IR strip with digital readout option enables rapid, hygienic fever screening in children and large populations.

**Paragraph**: Rapid, hygienic fever screening is crucial in pediatric and mass settings, especially during outbreaks. A paper-thin IR-sensitive strip with a visible color change and an optional digital interface (e.g., QR code for app reading) enhances usability, accuracy, and digital record-keeping while minimizing cross-contamination.

**Approach**: Develop colorimetric IR materials with high sensitivity; prototype strips with digital readout option; field-test for accuracy and usability in children and mass screening contexts.

**Key References**: [Ng 2009]; [Sund-Levander 2002]; **[Stoppa 2014]** (wearable/digital health, new).

**Modifications**:  
- Added digital readout/recording option.  
- Strengthens traceability, digital integration.  
- New citation for digital health interface.
