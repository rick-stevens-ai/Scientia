**Title**: Quantum Speedup for Integer Partition Counting via Integrated Amplitude Estimation, Quantum Walks, and Error Mitigation

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms that integrate amplitude estimation, quantum walks, and error mitigation can approximate integer partition counts for large n with superior scalability, accuracy, and robustness compared to classical and na√Øve quantum approaches.

**Paragraph**: Integer partition counting is pivotal in combinatorics, number theory, and statistical physics, with classical

**Approach**: es.

**Paragraph**: Integer partition counting is pivotal in combinatorics, number theory, and statistical physics, with classical approaches bottlenecked by exponential or high-degree polynomial runtimes. Quantum amplitude estimation offers quadratic speedup for estimation, and quantum walks further accelerate structured enumeration. By integrating amplitude estimation with quantum walks specifically tailored to partition lattices, and introducing error mitigation protocols, the algorithm achieves scalable, accurate, and reliable partition counting, enabling practical advances for large-scale problems in physics and cryptography.

**Approach**: Construct a quantum algorithm that encodes partition enumeration as a quantum walk on the partition lattice, leverages amplitude estimation for counting, and incorporates error mitigation (e.g., zero-noise extrapolation). Benchmark runtime, accuracy, and robustness against classical dynamic programming and pure amplitude estimation approaches for varying input sizes.
