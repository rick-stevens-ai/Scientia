**Title**: Quantum Amplitude Estimation and Variational Circuits for Approximating Binomial Coefficients

**Key Idea**: Quantum amplitude estimation, combined with variational circuits, can approximate large binomial coefficients efficiently and flexibly.

**Paragraph**: Binomial coefficients underpin probability theory and combinatorics but are hard to compute for large parameters. By encoding the binomial distribution in quantum states and optimizing with variational circuits, we can further reduce circuit depth while maintaining quadratic speedup from amplitude estimation. This hybrid

**Approach**: enhances practicality for near-term quantum devices.

**Approach**: Design a variational circuit to approximate the binomial distribution, apply amplitude estimation for coefficient extraction, and compare accuracy and efficiency with classical and standard quantum methods.

**Key References**: [Brassard 2002], [Stanley 1997], [Cerezo 2021] (Variational quantum algorithms).

**Modifications**:  
- Added variational circuits for near-term device compatibility.
- Emphasized flexibility and noise robustness.
- Added [Cerezo 2021].
