**Title**: Quantum-Enhanced Combinatorial Data Compression via Entanglement-Assisted Encoding and Amplitude Amplification

**Key Idea**: Quantum entanglement-assisted encoding, combined with amplitude amplification, can enable more efficient lossless and approximate compression of large combinatorial datasets than classical or standard quantum methods.

**Paragraph**: Efficient storage and transmission of large combinatorial datasets (e.g., graphs, codes, combinatorial designs) is a growing challenge in data science and network analysis. Quantum entanglement provides fundamentally new methods for information encoding, and amplitude amplification can accelerate the identification of optimal compression mappings. This dual

**Approach**: could yield significant compression improvements, especially for highly structured or redundant combinatorial data, and open new avenues for quantum data transmission and communication.

**Approach**: Develop quantum algorithms that use entanglement-assisted encoding of combinatorial objects, and apply amplitude amplification to search for optimal or near-optimal compression schemes. Benchmark compression ratios and decompression accuracy on synthetic and real combinatorial datasets, comparing with classical and na√Øve quantum compression protocols.
