**Title**: Robust Hybrid Quantum Walk–Grover Algorithms for Clique Detection with Topology-Aware Adaptation and Error Certification

**Key Idea**: Hybrid quantum walk–Grover algorithms, augmented with error certification and topology-aware adaptation, can detect large cliques in diverse graphs with fewer queries and higher reliability than classical and non-adaptive quantum approaches.

**Paragraph**: Clique detection, a core NP-hard challenge, is crucial in network science and bioinformatics. Quantum walks provide exponential speedup for structured search spaces, while Grover’s algorithm excels in unstructured regions. By interleaving these methods and adaptively selecting strategies based on local graph topology, the algorithm adapts to sparse, dense, or irregular graphs. Incorporating error certification ensures trustworthy results, making the

**Paragraph**: Clique detection, a core NP-hard challenge, is crucial in network science and bioinformatics. Quantum walks provide exponential speedup for structured search spaces, while Grover’s algorithm excels in unstructured regions. By interleaving these methods and adaptively selecting strategies based on local graph topology, the algorithm adapts to sparse, dense, or irregular graphs. Incorporating error certification ensures trustworthy results, making the approach practical for real-world noisy quantum devices and large-scale graphs.

**Approach**: Design a hybrid algorithm alternating quantum walks and Grover search, with adaptive switching based on graph topology, and integrate error certification (e.g., repeated runs/statistical confidence). Test on diverse synthetic and real-world graphs and compare performance, robustness, and reliability with classical and pure quantum baselines.
