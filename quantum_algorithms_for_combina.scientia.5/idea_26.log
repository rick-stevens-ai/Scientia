**Title**: Quantum Evaluation of the Möbius Function with Error Mitigation Techniques

**Key Idea**: Quantum circuits using error-mitigated factoring can evaluate the Möbius function μ(n) more efficiently and reliably than classical methods.

**Paragraph**: The Möbius function’s dependence on integer factorization makes it ideal for quantum speedup via Shor’s algorithm. For practical implementation, incorporating quantum error mitigation ensures accurate μ(n) computation even on noisy quantum devices, enabling scalable analytic number theory applications.

**Approach**: Integrate error mitigation (e.g., zero-noise extrapolation) with quantum factoring and Möbius evaluation, benchmarking accuracy and runtime against classical and error-prone quantum approaches.

**Key References**: [Shor 1994], [Apostol 1976], [Temme 2017] (Error mitigation for short-depth quantum circuits).

**Modifications**:  
- Added error mitigation for practical NISQ devices.
- Emphasized reliability and scalability.
- Added [Temme 2017].
