**Title**: Quantum Generation of Random Graphs with Prescribed Properties via Adaptive Amplitude Amplification and Certified Uniformity

**Key Idea**: Adaptive quantum amplitude amplification with error certification enables fast, provably uniform generation of random graphs with prescribed constraints, outperforming classical MCMC in speed and uniformity.

**Paragraph**: Generating random graphs with specific properties is essential in combinatorial probability and network science. Adaptive amplitude amplification accelerates sampling and ensures uniformity, while error certification protocols provide rigorous guarantees, making the

**Approach**: practical for large-scale and complex constraint settings.

**Approach**: Develop adaptive amplitude amplification circuits with error certification for random graph generation under degree and connectivity constraints. Compare uniformity, speed, and reliability with classical MCMC and non-certified quantum approaches.
