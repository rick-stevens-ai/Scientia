**Title**: Quantum Parallel Evaluation of Recurrence Relations with Dynamic Circuit Optimization

**Key Idea**: Quantum computers leveraging dynamic circuit optimization can accelerate the evaluation of high-order combinatorial recurrence relations via parallelism.

**Paragraph**: Many combinatorial sequences are governed by complex recurrences. Quantum parallelism, combined with dynamically optimized circuits, reduces depth and resource requirements for high-order or multi-index recurrences, making evaluation feasible for larger problems.

**Approach**: Implement dynamically optimized quantum circuits for various recurrence classes, analyze runtime and resource usage, and benchmark against classical dynamic programming.

**Key References**: [Nielsen 2010], [Stanley 1997], [Khatri 2019] (Quantum-assisted quantum compiling).

**Modifications**:  
- Added dynamic circuit optimization for deeper recurrences.
- Improved resource efficiency.
- Added [Khatri 2019].
