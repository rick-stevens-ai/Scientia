**Title**: Quantum Factoring with Adaptive Error Correction and Post-Processing for Reliable Euler’s Totient Function Computation

**Key Idea**: Quantum factoring algorithms, enhanced with adaptive error correction and robust post-processing, can compute Euler’s totient function φ(n) efficiently and reliably for cryptographic-scale inputs.

**Paragraph**: Euler’s totient function is essential for cryptography and number theory. Shor’s algorithm enables quantum factoring, while adaptive error correction (e.g., surface codes) ensures reliability. Post-processing steps (e.g., verifying prime factors and recomputing φ(n)) further enhance correctness, enabling practical φ(n) computation for large n on near-term and future quantum devices.

**Approach**: Integrate adaptive error correction and post-processing verification with Shor’s factoring, compute φ(n) for cryptographic-scale numbers, and benchmark accuracy, runtime, and reliability.
