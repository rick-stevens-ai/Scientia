**Title**: Quantum Approximate Counting for Perfect Matchings Using Error Certification, Adaptive Sampling, and Circuit Optimization

**Key Idea**: Quantum approximate counting, augmented with error certification, adaptive sampling, and circuit optimization, can reliably and efficiently estimate perfect matchings in bipartite graphs, outperforming classical approaches.

**Paragraph**: Perfect matching counting is #P-complete. Quantum amplitude estimation provides speedup, but adaptive sampling (dynamically adjusting sampling based on graph properties), error certification, and circuit optimization for NISQ devices enable robust and practical results, making the

**Approach**: es.

**Paragraph**: Perfect matching counting is #P-complete. Quantum amplitude estimation provides speedup, but adaptive sampling (dynamically adjusting sampling based on graph properties), error certification, and circuit optimization for NISQ devices enable robust and practical results, making the approach viable for chemistry, computer vision, and network analysis.

**Approach**: Implement quantum amplitude estimation with error certification, adaptive sampling, and circuit optimization; test on large bipartite graphs and compare with classical MCMC and permanent approximation.
