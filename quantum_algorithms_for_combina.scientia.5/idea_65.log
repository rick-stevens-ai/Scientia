**Paragraph**: Integer partition counting is pivotal in combinatorics, number theory, and statistical physics, yet classical approaches are bottlenecked by exponential or high-degree polynomial runtimes. Quantum amplitude estimation offers quadratic speedup, and quantum walks accelerate structured enumeration. Incorporating adaptive error mitigation (tailored to device noise patterns) and circuit optimizations (such as modular decompositions for partition lattices) further enhances scalability and accuracy. These advances collectively enable practical, reliable partition counting for large-scale problems relevant to physics, cryptography, and algorithmic number theory.

**Approach**: Construct a quantum algorithm encoding partition enumeration as a quantum walk on the partition lattice, leverage amplitude estimation for counting, and incorporate adaptive error mitigation (e.g., zero-noise extrapolation, device-specific calibration) and circuit optimization. Benchmark runtime, accuracy, and robustness against classical dynamic programming and pure amplitude estimation approaches for varying input sizes.
