**Title**: Quantum Hidden Subgroup Algorithms with Machine-Learned, Error-Mitigated Circuits and Adaptive Compilation for Graph Isomorphism

**Key Idea**: Quantum hidden subgroup algorithms, enhanced by machine-learned circuit optimization, adaptive compilation, and error mitigation, accelerate graph isomorphism testing for diverse graph families, including those challenging for classical or standard quantum approaches.

**Paragraph**: The graph isomorphism problem is computationally central and challenging. Quantum hidden subgroup algorithms promise speedups, yet practical performance hinges on circuit efficiency and noise resilience. Machine learning automates circuit optimization for specific graph classes, adaptive compilation tailors circuits to hardware, and error mitigation ensures result reliability, especially on NISQ devices and for complex graph structures.

**Approach**: es.
