**Title**: Quantum-Assisted Automated Conjecture Generation for Combinatorics via Symbolic Regression and Amplitude Amplification

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms leveraging amplitude amplification and quantum-assisted symbolic regression can accelerate the automated generation and validation of combinatorial conjectures.

**Paragraph**: The discovery of new combinatorial conjectures and identities often relies on exhaustive search and symbolic manipulation, which are computationally intensive. By integrating quantum amplitude amplification for efficient search over combinatorial object spaces with quantum-enhanced symbolic regression (using quantum annealers or circuits for function fitting), the process of automated conjecture generation and validation becomes significantly faster. This empowers mathematicians with rapid hypothesis discovery, especially in domains where the combinatorial explosion is prohibitive for classical systems.

**Approach**: Develop quantum algorithms for traversing combinatorial object spaces, combined with quantum-assisted symbolic regression to propose and validate conjectural relationships. Benchmark on classical conjecture datasets and explore new combinatorial domains, comparing speed and quality with classical symbolic computation.
