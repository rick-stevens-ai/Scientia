**Title**: Quantum Factoring with Adaptive Error Correction for Euler’s Totient Function

**Key Idea**: Quantum factoring algorithms with adaptive error correction can compute Euler’s totient function φ(n) efficiently and reliably for cryptographic-scale inputs.

**Paragraph**: Euler’s totient function is essential for cryptography. By combining Shor’s algorithm with adaptive quantum error correction (e.g., surface codes), we achieve reliable factorization for large n, enabling scalable φ(n) computation beyond classical reach.

**Approach**: Integrate adaptive error correction with Shor’s factoring, compute φ(n) for cryptographic-scale numbers, and benchmark accuracy and runtime.

**Key References**: [Shor 1994], [Apostol 1976], [Fowler 2012] (Surface codes for quantum error correction).

**Modifications**:  
- Added error correction for large, practical n.
- Emphasized cryptographic relevance.
- Added [Fowler 2012].
