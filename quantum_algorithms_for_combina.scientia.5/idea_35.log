**Title**: Quantum Amplitude Estimation for Partition Functions in Statistical and Combinatorial Models

**Key Idea**: Quantum amplitude estimation enables faster estimation of partition functions in both statistical mechanics and complex combinatorial models, with certified error bounds.

**Paragraph**: Partition functions are central to physics and combinatorics, but classically hard to estimate. Quantum amplitude estimation offers quadratic speedup and, when augmented with certified error bounds, ensures reliable results for models like the Ising model and beyond, broadening the impact on computational physics.

**Approach**: Develop quantum circuits for amplitude estimation with error certification, apply to Ising and Potts models, and compare certified accuracy and speed with classical Monte Carlo.

**Key References**: [Brassard 2002], [Jerrum 1993], [Montanaro 2015].

**Modifications**:  
- Emphasized certified error bounds for reliability.
- Extended to more general models (e.g., Potts).
- Added [Montanaro 2015].
