**Title**: Quantum Differential Privacy for Combinatorial Data Analysis with Amplitude Amplification

**Key Idea**: Quantum amplitude amplification combined with quantum differential privacy protocols can enable efficient, privacy-preserving analysis of large combinatorial datasets.

**Paragraph**: Analyzing combinatorial datasets (e.g., subgraphs, codes, motifs) often conflicts with privacy requirements, especially in biological or social networks. Quantum differential privacy, recently formalized, allows private data analysis with quantum speedups from amplitude amplification. This

**Approach**: not only preserves individual data privacy but also enables efficient computation of global combinatorial statistics, potentially revolutionizing privacy-sensitive domains like genomics, finance, and social science.

**Approach**: Design quantum protocols that integrate amplitude amplification with differential privacy mechanisms (e.g., quantum noise addition, private query protocols), and apply to combinatorial counting and motif detection in sensitive datasets. Compare privacy guarantees, efficiency, and scalability with classical and na√Øve quantum differentially private algorithms.
