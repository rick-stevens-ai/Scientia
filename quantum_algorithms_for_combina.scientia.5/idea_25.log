**Title**: Parameterized Quantum Algorithms for Subset Sum with Adaptive Search

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms utilizing parameter tuning and adaptive amplitude amplification can achieve superpolynomial speedup for subset sum in specific instance regimes.

**Paragraph**: The subset sum problem, foundational in cryptography, has worst-case hardness but admits quantum speedups in moderate-density or bounded-sum instances. By parameterizing quantum walk and amplitude amplification strategies based on instance characteristics (e.g., sum density, element range), adaptive quantum algorithms can exploit structure, outperforming both classical and non-adaptive quantum solvers for practical cases.

**Approach**: Implement adaptive quantum algorithms that tune walk depth and amplification based on input statistics, analyze on random and structured instances, and compare to classical dynamic programming and meet-in-the-middle.

**Key References**: [Grover 1997], [Ding 2018], [Ambainis 2004] (Quantum search of structured databases).

**Modifications**:  
- Parameterized/adaptive algorithm based on instance regime.
- Clarified practical advantage for moderate-density cases.
- Added [Ambainis 2004].
