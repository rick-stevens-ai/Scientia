**Title**: Quantum Factoring with Adaptive Error Correction, Post-Processing Verification, and Circuit Optimization for Reliable Euler’s Totient Function Computation

**Key Idea**: Quantum factoring algorithms, enhanced with adaptive error correction, post-processing, and circuit optimization, can compute Euler’s totient function φ(n) efficiently and reliably for cryptographic-scale inputs.

**Paragraph**: Euler’s totient function is essential for cryptography and number theory. Shor’s algorithm enables quantum factoring, adaptive error correction (e.g., surface codes) and circuit optimization ensure reliability, and post-processing (verifying prime factors and recomputing φ(n)) further enhances correctness, enabling practical φ(n) computation for large n.

**Approach**: Integrate adaptive error correction, circuit optimization, and post-processing verification with Shor’s factoring, compute φ(n) for cryptographic-scale numbers, and benchmark accuracy and runtime.
