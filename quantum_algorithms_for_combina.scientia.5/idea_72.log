**Title**: Heuristic-Pruned Quantum Backtracking for Hamiltonian Cycle Detection with Error Certification and Adaptive Compilation

**Key Idea**: Quantum backtracking, augmented with classical heuristic pruning, error certification, and adaptive compilation, delivers scalable and reliable Hamiltonian cycle detection in complex graphs.

**Paragraph**: Hamiltonian cycle detection is a key combinatorial optimization problem. Quantum backtracking offers speedup, heuristic pruning reduces the search space, and adaptive compilation enhances hardware efficiency. Integrating error certification protocols further ensures reliability, enabling the

**Approach**: to outperform both classical heuristics and na√Øve quantum backtracking on structured or sparse graphs.

**Approach**: Implement quantum backtracking with heuristic pruning, error certification (e.g., repeated trials/statistical analysis), and adaptive compilation; test on synthetic and real-world graphs.
