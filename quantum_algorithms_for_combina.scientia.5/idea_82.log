**Title**: Quantum Permanent Estimation for Structured and Random Matrices Using Error-Bounded Approximate Counting, Adaptive Sampling, and Circuit Optimization

**Key Idea**: Quantum approximate counting with certified error bounds, adaptive sampling, and circuit optimization efficiently estimates the permanent of both random and structured matrices, improving reliability and speed over classical methods.

**Paragraph**: Matrix permanents are #P-complete to compute, with classical approximation limited in reliability. Quantum amplitude estimation, especially when enhanced with error bounds, adaptive sampling, and circuit optimization, makes estimation practical for matrices in physics and network theory, offering strong guarantees for applications in quantum optics and graph analysis.

**Approach**: Develop quantum amplitude estimation with error bounding, adaptive sampling, and circuit optimization for permanent estimation, validate on random and structured matrices.
