**Title**: Quantum Lattice Basis Reduction with Post-Processing for Integer Relation Discovery

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms for lattice reduction, followed by classical post-processing, can reveal integer relations more efficiently in high-dimensional settings.

**Paragraph**: Lattice basis reduction is vital for number theory and cryptography. Quantum algorithms (e.g., quantum SVP) provide speedup, and combining them with classical post-processing (e.g., LLL or BKZ refinement) ensures practical accuracy and robustness, making integer relation discovery feasible in higher dimensions.

**Approach**: Implement quantum SVP for lattice reduction, followed by classical LLL/BKZ, and test on high-dimensional integer relation problems, comparing total runtime and solution quality.

**Key References**: [Regev 2009], [Lenstra 1982], [Micciancio 2009] (Lattice algorithms and cryptography).

**Modifications**:  
- Added classical post-processing for robustness.
- Targeted high-dimensional practical problems.
- Added [Micciancio 2009].
