**Title**: Quantum Circuits with Parallel Amplitude Estimation and Error Mitigation for Efficient Ramanujan Tau Function Evaluation

**Key Idea**: Quantum circuits leveraging modular arithmetic, parallel amplitude estimation, and error mitigation protocols can efficiently and reliably evaluate the Ramanujan tau function, outperforming classical methods for large n.

**Paragraph**: The Ramanujan tau function is central in modular forms and cryptography, but its computation scales poorly classically. Quantum modular subroutines and parallel amplitude estimation offer significant speedups. By integrating error mitigation techniques, the solution remains accurate even on noisy quantum hardware, broadening applicability to cryptographic and mathematical applications.

**Approach**: Develop quantum modular arithmetic subroutines, integrate parallel amplitude estimation, and use error mitigation (e.g., extrapolation or randomized compiling). Benchmark the pipeline for tau(n) with classical, na√Øve quantum, and error-mitigated quantum approaches.

**Key References**: [Shor 1994], [Kolountzakis 1997], [Cleve 1998], [Temme 2017] (added for error mitigation).

**Modifications**:  
- **Extended**: Added explicit error mitigation for reliability in noisy regimes.
- **Strengthened**: Enhanced robustness for cryptographic-scale computations.
- **New citation**: [Temme 2017].
