**Title**: Quantum Algorithms for Efficient and Parallel Evaluation of the Ramanujan Tau Function

**Key Idea**: Quantum circuits leveraging modular arithmetic and parallel amplitude estimation can evaluate the Ramanujan tau function more efficiently than classical methods.

**Paragraph**: The Ramanujan tau function, central to modular forms, has computation complexity growing rapidly with input size. By employing quantum subroutines for modular arithmetic and parallel amplitude estimation, we can achieve significant runtimes improvements. Quantum parallelism enables simultaneous evaluation of modular conditions, enhancing efficiency for large n and supporting applications in cryptography.

**Approach**: Develop modular quantum arithmetic subroutines, integrate parallel amplitude estimation, and benchmark the full pipeline for tau(n) against classical and na√Øve quantum approaches.

**Key References**: [Shor 1994], [Kolountzakis 1997], [Cleve 1998] (Quantum algorithms revisited).

**Modifications**:  
- Added parallel amplitude estimation for further speedup.
- Emphasized modular arithmetic and parallelism.
- Added [Cleve 1998].
