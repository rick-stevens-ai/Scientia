**Title**: Quantum-Accelerated Ramsey Number Estimation with Machine-Learned Search, Error Certification, and Adaptive Compilation

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms combining amplitude amplification, quantum machine learning, error certification, and adaptive compilation can yield tighter and more reliable Ramsey number bounds through accelerated search and structural pattern recognition.

**Paragraph**: Ramsey numbers are central yet computationally formidable. Quantum search accelerates counterexample discovery, quantum machine learning uncovers structural patterns, and adaptive compilation ensures hardware efficiency. Error certification protocols ensure confidence in results, making the

**Approach**: practical for mathematical and combinatorial research.

**Approach**: Use Groverâ€™s search for explicit counterexample search, quantum machine learning for pattern-guided candidate generation, error certification protocols, and adaptive compilation. Benchmark improvements in speed, quality, and reliability.

**Key References**: [Grover 1997], [Radziszowski 1994], [Biamonte 2017], [Knill 2007], [Khatri 2019].

**Modifications**:
- **Extended**: Added adaptive compilation.
- **Strengthened**: Improved practical feasibility for NISQ devices.
