**Title**: Quantum Adaptive Amplitude Amplification for Uniform Generation of Combinatorial Objects with Error Certification

**Key Idea**: Quantum amplitude amplification with adaptive sampling and error certification enables efficient and provably uniform generation of combinatorial objects, outperforming classical approaches for complex or high-rejection settings.

**Paragraph**: Random generation is foundational in combinatorics and randomized algorithms. Quantum amplitude amplification accelerates sampling, and adaptive schemes (dynamically tuning acceptance based on prior outcomes) further reduce sample requirements. Error certification ensures uniformity and reliability, even for complex combinatorial classes.

**Approach**: es for complex or high-rejection settings.

Error certification ensures uniformity and reliability, even for complex combinatorial classes.

**Approach**: Implement adaptive amplitude amplification with error certification for generating permutations, combinations, and other combinatorial objects. Validate uniformity, efficiency, and reliability compared to classical rejection/Markov sampling.
