**Title**: Quantum Amplitude Estimation with Variational Circuits and Error Mitigation for Robust Binomial Coefficient Approximation

**Key Idea**: Quantum amplitude estimation, combined with variational circuits and error mitigation techniques, can efficiently and reliably approximate large binomial coefficients, making the approach practical for near-term quantum devices.

**Paragraph**: Binomial coefficients are foundational in probability and combinatorics, yet challenging for large inputs. Quantum amplitude estimation provides quadratic speedup, while variational circuits enable flexible and shallow implementations ideal for NISQ devices. By incorporating error mitigation, the

**Approach**: practical for near-term quantum devices.

**Paragraph**: Binomial coefficients are foundational in probability and combinatorics, yet challenging for large inputs. Quantum amplitude estimation provides quadratic speedup, while variational circuits enable flexible and shallow implementations ideal for NISQ devices. By incorporating error mitigation, the approach is both efficient and reliable, providing practical estimations even in noisy hardware environments.

**Approach**: Design variational circuits to encode binomial distributions, apply amplitude estimation for coefficient extraction, and use error mitigation (e.g., extrapolation). Compare accuracy, efficiency, and robustness with classical and standard quantum methods.
