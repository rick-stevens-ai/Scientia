**Title**: Quantum Parallel Evaluation of Recurrence Relations with Dynamic, Adaptive Circuit Optimization and Certified Error Bounds for High-Dimensional Problems

**Key Idea**: Quantum computers using dynamic and adaptive circuit optimization, along with certified error bounds, can accelerate evaluation of high-order combinatorial recurrence relations in parallel, with improved resource efficiency and reliability.

**Paragraph**: High-order recurrences underpin complex combinatorial sequences. Quantum parallelism accelerates evaluation, dynamic and adaptive circuit optimization minimizes depth and resources, and error certification ensures reliable computation for larger, high-dimensional problems.

**Approach**: Implement dynamically and adaptively optimized quantum circuits for various recurrence classes, incorporate error mitigation and certification, and benchmark runtime, resource use, and reliability.
