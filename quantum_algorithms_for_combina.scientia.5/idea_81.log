**Title**: Quantum Period-Finding for Pell’s Equation with Security Analysis, Error Certification, and Adaptive Compilation for Post-Quantum Cryptography

**Key Idea**: Quantum period-finding algorithms, supported by error certification and adaptive compilation, efficiently solve Pell’s equation and assess post-quantum security of related cryptosystems with high reliability.

**Paragraph**: Pell’s equation represents a classic number-theoretic challenge where quantum period-finding achieves exponential speedup. Incorporating error certification and adaptive circuit compilation enables trustworthy cryptanalysis of protocols based on Pell’s hardness, directly informing the design of post-quantum cryptography.

**Approach**: Implement quantum period-finding for Pell’s equation with error certification and adaptive compilation, analyze cryptosystems based on Pell’s hardness, and compare with classical and non-certified quantum methods.
