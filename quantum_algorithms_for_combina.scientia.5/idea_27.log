**Title**: Quantum Hidden Subgroup and Machine-Learned Circuits for Graph Isomorphism

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem, enhanced by machine-learned circuit optimizations, can accelerate graph isomorphism testing, especially for complex graph families.

**Paragraph**: The graph isomorphism problem, pivotal in computer science, can benefit from quantum hidden subgroup

**Approach**: es. Recent advances in machine learning allow the automatic discovery of optimized quantum circuits, potentially improving performance on real-world graph instances by tailoring circuits to specific graph classes.

**Approach**: Combine hidden subgroup quantum routines with machine learning-driven circuit optimization; test on various graph families, including those difficult for classical solvers.

**Key References**: [Babai 2016], [Beals 1997], [Yuan 2022] (Machine learning for quantum circuit optimization).

**Modifications**:  
- Augmented with machine-learned circuit optimization.
- Addressed adaptability to real graph families.
- Added [Yuan 2022].
