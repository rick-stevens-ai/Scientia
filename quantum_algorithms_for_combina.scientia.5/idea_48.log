**Title**: Quantum Möbius Function Evaluation Using Factoring, Error Mitigation, and Adaptive Circuit Compilation

**Key Idea**: Quantum circuits employing error-mitigated factoring and adaptive circuit compilation can evaluate the Möbius function μ(n) more efficiently and reliably than classical and naïve quantum methods.

**Paragraph**: Evaluation of μ(n) is vital for analytic number theory and cryptanalysis, hinging on integer factorization—an ideal quantum speedup target. By combining Shor’s algorithm with error mitigation and adaptive compilation (tailoring gates to hardware noise profiles), the method achieves accurate and scalable Möbius computation, even on current noisy quantum hardware.

**Approach**: Integrate error mitigation (e.g., zero-noise extrapolation) and adaptive compilation with quantum factoring and Möbius evaluation. Benchmark accuracy, runtime, and hardware adaptability against classical and non-optimized quantum approaches.

**Key References**: [Shor 1994], [Apostol 1976], [Temme 2017], [Khatri 2019] (added for adaptive compiling).

**Modifications**:  
- **Extended**: Added adaptive circuit compilation for hardware efficiency.
- **Strengthened**: Increased reliability and hardware adaptability.
- **New citation**: [Khatri 2019].
