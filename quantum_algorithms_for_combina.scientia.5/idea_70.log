**Title**: Quantum Möbius Function Evaluation Using Error-Mitigated Factoring, Adaptive Compilation, and Post-Processing Verification

**Key Idea**: Quantum circuits employing error-mitigated factoring, adaptive compilation, and post-processing verification can evaluate the Möbius function μ(n) more efficiently and reliably than classical and naïve quantum methods.

**Paragraph**: Evaluation of μ(n) is vital for analytic number theory and cryptanalysis, hinging on integer factorization—an ideal quantum speedup target. By combining Shor’s algorithm with adaptive error mitigation, circuit compilation tailored to hardware noise profiles, and classical post-processing to verify prime factors, the method achieves accurate, scalable Möbius computation even on current noisy quantum hardware.

**Approach**: Integrate error mitigation (e.g., zero-noise extrapolation), adaptive compilation, and post-processing verification with quantum factoring and Möbius evaluation. Benchmark accuracy, runtime, and hardware adaptability.

**Key References**: [Shor 1994], [Apostol 1976], [Temme 2017], [Khatri 2019].

**Modifications**:
- **Extended**: Added post-processing verification.
- **Strengthened**: Improved correctness and reliability.
- **New detail**: Post-processing step.
