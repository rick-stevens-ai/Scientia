**Title**: Quantum Parallel Evaluation of Recurrence Relations with Dynamic and Adaptive Circuit Optimization for High-Dimensional Problems

**Key Idea**: Quantum computers using dynamic and adaptive circuit optimization can accelerate evaluation of high-order combinatorial recurrence relations in parallel, with improved resource efficiency and reliability.

**Paragraph**: High-order recurrences underpin complex combinatorial sequences. Quantum parallelism accelerates evaluation, while dynamic and adaptive circuit optimization (modifying circuits based on hardware feedback and recurrence structure) minimizes depth and resources. Error mitigation and certification further ensure reliable computation for larger, high-dimensional problems.

**Approach**: Implement dynamically and adaptively optimized quantum circuits for various recurrence classes, incorporate error mitigation and certification, and benchmark runtime, resource use, and reliability against classical dynamic programming.
