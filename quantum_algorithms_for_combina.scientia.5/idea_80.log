**Title**: Quantum Adaptive Amplitude Amplification for Uniform Generation of Combinatorial Objects with Certified Uniformity and Circuit Optimization

**Key Idea**: Quantum amplitude amplification with adaptive sampling, error certification, and circuit optimization enables efficient and provably uniform generation of combinatorial objects, outperforming classical approaches for complex or high-rejection settings.

**Paragraph**: Random generation is foundational in combinatorics and randomized algorithms. Quantum amplitude amplification accelerates sampling, adaptive schemes reduce sample requirements, error certification ensures uniformity and reliability, and circuit optimization extends feasibility to near-term devices.

**Approach**: es for complex or high-rejection settings.
