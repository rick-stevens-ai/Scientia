**Title**: Quantum Lattice Basis Reduction Enhanced with Classical Post-Processing and Error Mitigation for High-Dimensional Integer Relation Discovery

**Key Idea**: Quantum lattice reduction algorithms, integrated with classical post-processing and error mitigation, can efficiently reveal integer relations in high-dimensional spaces with improved robustness and reliability.

**Paragraph**: Lattice basis reduction is critical for number theory and cryptography. Quantum SVP algorithms provide speedup, and combining them with classical LLL/BKZ post-processing and error mitigation ensures practical accuracy even on noisy quantum hardware, making integer relation discovery feasible for larger instances.

**Approach**: Implement quantum SVP for lattice reduction, followed by classical LLL/BKZ and error mitigation. Test on high-dimensional integer relation problems, benchmark total runtime, solution quality, and reliability against classical and non-optimized quantum approaches.
