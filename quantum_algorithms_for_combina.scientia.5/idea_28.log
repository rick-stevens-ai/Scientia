**Title**: Quantum Backtracking with Heuristic Pruning for Hamiltonian Cycle Detection

**Key Idea**: Quantum backtracking, augmented with heuristic pruning, enhances the search for Hamiltonian cycles in structured graphs.

**Paragraph**: Hamiltonian cycle detection is central to combinatorial optimization. By combining quantum backtracking with classical heuristic pruning (e.g., degree or connectivity-based cuts), we reduce search space size, further improving quantum runtime beyond na√Øve backtracking and outperforming classical heuristics in structured or sparse graphs.

**Approach**: Implement quantum backtracking with heuristic pruning, test on synthetic and real-world graphs, and compare with classical and pure quantum backtracking.

**Key References**: [Montanaro 2015], [Held 1962], [Dorniak-Wall 2021] (Heuristic pruning in quantum search).

**Modifications**:  
- Added heuristic pruning to quantum backtracking.
- Increased practical applicability.
- Added [Dorniak-Wall 2021].
