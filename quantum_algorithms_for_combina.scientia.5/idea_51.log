**Title**: Quantum Estimation of Graph Zeta Functions with Block-Encoding, Error Mitigation, and Scalable Circuit Optimization

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms employing block-encoding, quantum linear system solvers, error mitigation, and scalable circuit optimization can estimate Ihara zeta functions of large graphs with exponential speedup and reliability beyond classical determinant methods.

**Paragraph**: Computing the Ihara zeta function is classically bottlenecked by large matrix determinants. Quantum block-encoding and linear solvers drastically improve scalability. Adding error mitigation and scalable circuit optimization (e.g., modular decomposition of graph matrices) ensures accurate, practical results on noisy quantum devices, enabling new insights in network science and spectral graph theory.

**Approach**: Develop block-encoded quantum representations for graph matrices, apply quantum linear solvers with error mitigation and scalable circuit design, and benchmark on diverse graph classes against classical and non-optimized quantum approaches.
