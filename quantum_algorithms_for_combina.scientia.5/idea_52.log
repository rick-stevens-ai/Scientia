**Title**: Quantum-Accelerated Ramsey Number Estimation with Machine-Learned Search and Error Certification

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms combining amplitude amplification, quantum machine learning, and error certification can yield tighter and more reliable Ramsey number bounds through accelerated search and structural pattern recognition.

**Paragraph**: Ramsey numbers are central yet computationally formidable. Quantum search accelerates counterexample discovery, while quantum machine learning uncovers structural patterns, guiding search and enabling tighter bounds. Incorporating error certification ensures confidence in results, making the

**Approach**: practical for mathematical and combinatorial research.

**Approach**: Use Groverâ€™s search for explicit counterexample search, quantum machine learning for pattern-guided candidate generation, and error certification protocols. Benchmark improvements in speed, quality, and reliability over classical and pure quantum search approaches.
