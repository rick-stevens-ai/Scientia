**Title**: Quantum Amplitude Estimation with Variational Circuits, Adaptive Error Mitigation, and Circuit Optimization for Robust Binomial Coefficient Approximation

**Key Idea**: Quantum amplitude estimation, combined with variational circuits, adaptive error mitigation, and circuit optimization, can efficiently and reliably approximate large binomial coefficients, making the approach practical for near-term quantum devices.

**Paragraph**: Binomial coefficients are foundational in probability and combinatorics, yet challenging for large inputs. Quantum amplitude estimation provides quadratic speedup, while variational circuits enable flexible and shallow implementations ideal for NISQ devices. Introducing adaptive error mitigation and circuit optimization ensures both efficiency and reliability, yielding practical estimations even on noisy hardware.

**Approach**: practical for near-term quantum devices.
