**Title**: Quantum Fourier Transform Algorithms for Cyclotomic Polynomial Coefficient Computation

**Key Idea**: Quantum Fourier transforms, combined with modular arithmetic subroutines, can efficiently compute cyclotomic polynomial coefficients for large degrees.

**Paragraph**: Cyclotomic polynomials are critical in algebra and cryptography. Quantum Fourier transforms, when paired with modular arithmetic circuits, allow scalable computation of coefficients even for high degrees, enabling new applications in coding theory and cryptography.

**Approach**: Develop modular arithmetic and QFT circuits, validate on large-degree polynomials, and compare speed and accuracy with classical symbolic algebra systems.

**Key References**: [Nielsen 2010], [Washington 1997], [Cleve 1998].

**Modifications**:  
- Emphasized modular arithmetic and QFT synergy.
- Highlighted applications in cryptography.
- Added [Cleve 1998].
