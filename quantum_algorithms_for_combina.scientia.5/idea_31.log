**Title**: Quantum Approximate Counting for Perfect Matchings with Error Certification

**Key Idea**: Quantum approximate counting, augmented with error certification protocols, can reliably estimate the number of perfect matchings in bipartite graphs faster than classical MCMC.

**Paragraph**: Perfect matching counting is #P-complete. Quantum amplitude estimation provides speedup, but for practical significance, error certification (e.g., robust confidence intervals from repeated quantum runs) ensures trustworthy outputs, making the

**Approach**: viable for applications in chemistry and computer vision.

**Approach**: Implement quantum amplitude estimation with repeated runs for error certification, test on large bipartite graphs, and compare with classical MCMC and permanent approximation.

**Key References**: [Jerrum 2004], [Brassard 2002], [Knill 2007] (Randomized benchmarking for quantum error estimation).

**Modifications**:  
- Added error certification protocols.
- Focused on reliability for practical use.
- Added [Knill 2007].
