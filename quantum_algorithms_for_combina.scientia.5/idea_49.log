**Title**: Quantum Hidden Subgroup Algorithms with Machine-Learned and Error-Mitigated Circuits for Graph Isomorphism

**Key Idea**: Quantum hidden subgroup algorithms, enhanced by machine-learned circuit optimization and error mitigation, accelerate graph isomorphism testing for diverse graph families, including those challenging for classical or standard quantum approaches.

**Paragraph**: The graph isomorphism problem is computationally central and challenging. Quantum hidden subgroup algorithms promise speedups, but practical performance depends on circuit efficiency and noise resilience. Machine learning automates circuit optimization for specific graph classes, and error mitigation ensures result reliability, especially on NISQ devices.

**Approach**: es.
