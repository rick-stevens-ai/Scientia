**Title**: Quantum-Accelerated Search and Learning for Ramsey Number Estimation

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms combining amplitude amplification and quantum machine learning can yield tighter Ramsey number bounds through faster search and pattern recognition.

**Paragraph**: Ramsey numbers are central yet notoriously hard to compute. Quantum search accelerates the discovery of counterexamples, while quantum machine learning can identify structural patterns in extremal graphs, guiding the search and refining upper/lower bounds more efficiently.

**Approach**: Apply Groverâ€™s search for explicit counterexample search, and quantum machine learning to classify and generate candidate graphs, benchmarking improvements over classical and pure search methods.

**Key References**: [Grover 1997], [Radziszowski 1994], [Biamonte 2017] (Quantum machine learning).

**Modifications**:  
- Added quantum machine learning for pattern-guided search.
- Emphasized structural guidance.
- Added [Biamonte 2017].
