**Title**: Quantum Estimation of Graph Zeta Functions with Block-Encoding, Adaptive Error Mitigation, and Scalable Circuit Optimization

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms employing block-encoding, quantum linear system solvers, adaptive error mitigation, and scalable circuit optimization can estimate Ihara zeta functions of large graphs with exponential speedup and reliability beyond classical determinant methods.

**Paragraph**: Computing the Ihara zeta function is classically bottlenecked by large matrix determinants. Quantum block-encoding and linear solvers drastically improve scalability. Adding adaptive error mitigation and scalable circuit optimization (e.g., modular decomposition of graph matrices) ensures accurate, practical results on noisy quantum devices, enabling new insights in network science and spectral graph theory.

**Approach**: Develop block-encoded quantum representations for graph matrices, apply quantum linear solvers with adaptive error mitigation and scalable circuit design, and benchmark on diverse graph classes.

**Key References**: [Harrow 2009], [Stark 1996], [Gily√©n 2019], [Temme 2017], [Khatri 2019].

**Modifications**:
- **Extended**: Clarified adaptive error mitigation.
- **Strengthened**: Improved scalability and NISQ feasibility.
