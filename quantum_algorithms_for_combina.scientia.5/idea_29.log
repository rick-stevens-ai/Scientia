**Title**: Quantum Estimation of Graph Zeta Functions with Block-Encoding Techniques

**Key Idea**: Quantum algorithms using block-encoding and linear system solvers can estimate Ihara zeta functions of large graphs with exponential speedup over classical determinant methods.

**Paragraph**: The Ihara zeta function’s determinant-based computation is a major bottleneck for large graphs. Quantum block-encoding enables efficient manipulation of large matrices, and when combined with quantum linear system solvers, allows estimation of zeta functions for graphs far beyond classical reach, with potential applications in network science and spectral graph theory.

**Approach**: Develop block-encoded representations of graph matrices, apply quantum linear solvers, and benchmark zeta function estimations for varied graph classes.

**Key References**: [Harrow 2009], [Stark 1996], [Gilyén 2019] (Quantum singular value transformation and block-encoding).

**Modifications**:  
- Incorporated block-encoding for efficient matrix representation.
- Addressed applicability to larger graphs.
- Added [Gilyén 2019].
