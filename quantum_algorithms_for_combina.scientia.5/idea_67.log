**Title**: Quantum Circuits with Parallel Amplitude Estimation, Adaptive Error Mitigation, and Circuit Optimization for Efficient Ramanujan Tau Function Evaluation

**Key Idea**: Quantum circuits leveraging modular arithmetic, parallel amplitude estimation, adaptive error mitigation, and circuit optimization can efficiently and reliably evaluate the Ramanujan tau function, outperforming classical methods for large n.

**Paragraph**: The Ramanujan tau function is central in modular forms and cryptography, but its computation scales poorly classically. Quantum modular subroutines and parallel amplitude estimation offer significant speedups. Adaptive error mitigation and circuit optimization ensure accuracy and hardware efficiency even on noisy quantum hardware, broadening applicability to cryptographic and mathematical applications at scale.

**Approach**: Develop quantum modular arithmetic subroutines, integrate parallel amplitude estimation, use adaptive error mitigation (e.g., device-specific noise tailoring), and optimize circuits for hardware efficiency. Benchmark the pipeline for tau(n) with classical, na√Øve quantum, and error-mitigated quantum approaches.
