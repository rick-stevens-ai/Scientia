**Title**: Quantum Approximate Counting for Perfect Matchings Using Error Certification and Adaptive Sampling

**Key Idea**: Quantum approximate counting, augmented with error certification and adaptive sampling strategies, can reliably and efficiently estimate perfect matchings in bipartite graphs, outperforming classical approaches.

**Paragraph**: Perfect matching counting is #P-complete. Quantum amplitude estimation provides speedup, but adaptive sampling (dynamically adjusting sampling based on graph properties) and error certification enable robust, practical results, making the

**Paragraph**: Perfect matching counting is #P-complete. Quantum amplitude estimation provides speedup, but adaptive sampling (dynamically adjusting sampling based on graph properties) and error certification enable robust, practical results, making the approach viable for chemistry, computer vision, and network analysis.

**Approach**: Implement quantum amplitude estimation with repeated runs for error certification and adaptive sampling, test on large bipartite graphs, and compare with classical MCMC and permanent approximation.
