**Title**: Heuristic-Pruned Quantum Backtracking for Hamiltonian Cycle Detection with Error Certification

**Key Idea**: Quantum backtracking, augmented with classical heuristic pruning and error certification, delivers scalable and reliable Hamiltonian cycle detection in complex graphs.

**Paragraph**: Hamiltonian cycle detection is a key combinatorial optimization problem. Quantum backtracking offers speedup, while heuristic pruning drastically reduces the search space. Integrating error certification protocols further ensures the reliability of detected cycles, enabling the

**Approach**: to outperform both classical heuristics and na√Øve quantum backtracking on structured or sparse graphs.

**Approach**: Implement quantum backtracking with heuristic pruning and error certification (e.g., repeated trials/statistical analysis), test on synthetic and real-world graphs, and compare efficiency and reliability with classical and pure quantum baselines.
