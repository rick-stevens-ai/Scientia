**Title**: Quantum Lattice Basis Reduction Enhanced with Classical Post-Processing, Adaptive Error Mitigation, and Circuit Optimization for High-Dimensional Integer Relation Discovery

**Key Idea**: Quantum lattice reduction algorithms, integrated with classical post-processing, adaptive error mitigation, and circuit optimization, can efficiently reveal integer relations in high-dimensional spaces with improved robustness and reliability.

**Paragraph**: Lattice basis reduction is critical for number theory and cryptography. Quantum SVP algorithms provide speedup, and combining them with classical LLL/BKZ post-processing, adaptive error mitigation, and circuit optimization ensures practical accuracy even on noisy quantum hardware, making integer relation discovery feasible for larger instances.

**Approach**: Implement quantum SVP for lattice reduction, followed by classical LLL/BKZ, adaptive error mitigation, and circuit optimization. Test on high-dimensional integer relation problems.
