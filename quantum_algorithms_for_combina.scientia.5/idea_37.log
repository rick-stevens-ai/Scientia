**Title**: Quantum Period-Finding Algorithms for Pell’s Equation with Post-Quantum Security Analysis

**Key Idea**: Quantum period-finding algorithms solve Pell’s equation in polynomial time and can assess post-quantum security implications for related cryptosystems.

**Paragraph**: Pell’s equation is a classical number-theoretic challenge, and quantum period-finding (as in Shor’s algorithm) solves it efficiently. Extending this, the

**Approach**: enables analysis of cryptosystems based on hard instances of Pell’s equation, evaluating their post-quantum security.

**Approach**: Implement quantum period-finding for Pell’s equation, analyze cryptographic protocols based on Pell’s hardness, and compare with classical security assumptions.
