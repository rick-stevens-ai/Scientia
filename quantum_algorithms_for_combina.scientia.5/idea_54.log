**Title**: Modular Arithmetic and Quantum Fourier Transform Algorithms for Large-Scale Cyclotomic Polynomial Coefficient Computation with Error Mitigation

**Key Idea**: Quantum Fourier transforms, paired with modular arithmetic subroutines and error mitigation, enable efficient and reliable computation of cyclotomic polynomial coefficients for large degrees.

**Paragraph**: Cyclotomic polynomials are vital in algebra and cryptography. Quantum Fourier transform accelerates coefficient computation, and modular arithmetic circuits boost efficiency. Integrating error mitigation techniques ensures accuracy on noisy quantum devices, making the solution practical for advanced cryptographic and coding-theoretic applications.

**Approach**: Develop modular arithmetic and QFT circuits with error mitigation (e.g., zero-noise extrapolation), validate on large-degree polynomials, and compare speed, accuracy, and robustness with classical symbolic algebra systems.

**Key References**: [Nielsen 2010], [Washington 1997], [Cleve 1998], [Temme 2017].

**Modifications**:  
- **Extended**: Added error mitigation for NISQ reliability.
- **Strengthened**: Emphasized large-scale, practical applications.
- **New citation**: [Temme 2017].
