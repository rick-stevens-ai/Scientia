**Title**: Quantum Algorithms for Learning Combinatorial Properties via Quantum Boltzmann Machines

**Key Idea**: Quantum Boltzmann machines can learn and generate distributions over complex combinatorial structures more efficiently than classical machine learning models.

**Paragraph**: Machine learning for combinatorial structures (e.g., learning graph motifs, Latin squares, or error-correcting codes) is hindered by exponential state spaces. Quantum Boltzmann machines use quantum annealing or circuit-based sampling to efficiently learn and synthesize distributions over these spaces, enabling new capabilities in automated conjecture generation and combinatorial design.

**Approach**: Implement quantum Boltzmann machine learning for key combinatorial sets (e.g., subgraph motifs), compare learning speed and generative quality with classical deep learning models, and explore applications in automated conjecture discovery.
