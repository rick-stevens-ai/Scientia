**Title**: Robust Hybrid Quantum Walk–Grover Algorithms for Clique Detection with Topology-Aware Adaptation, Error Certification, and Resource-Efficient Compilation

**Key Idea**: Hybrid quantum walk–Grover algorithms, augmented with error certification, topology-aware adaptation, and resource-efficient compilation, can detect large cliques in diverse graphs with fewer queries and higher reliability than classical and non-adaptive quantum approaches.

**Paragraph**: Clique detection, a core NP-hard challenge, is essential in network science and bioinformatics. Quantum walks provide exponential speedups for structured search spaces, while Grover's algorithm excels for unstructured regions. By adaptively interleaving these methods based on local graph topology and implementing resource-efficient circuit compilation, the algorithm handles sparse, dense, or irregular graphs. Incorporating error certification ensures trustworthy results, rendering the method viable for noisy quantum devices and large-scale graphs.

**Approach**: Design a hybrid algorithm alternating quantum walks and Grover search, with adaptive switching based on graph structure and resource-efficient compilation, and integrate error certification (e.g., repeated runs/statistical confidence). Test on diverse synthetic and real-world graphs, comparing performance, robustness, and reliability with classical and pure quantum baselines.
