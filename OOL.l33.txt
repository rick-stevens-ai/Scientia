=== SUPERVISOR INTRO ===
**Round 1: Initialization and Idea Generation**

I have received the high-level research goal: "Develop new theories about the origin of life, considering novel perspectives that have not been previously explored in the scientific literature." 

To initiate the process, I will activate the **Generation Agent** to produce a set of initial ideas. The Generation Agent is tasked with creating diverse and innovative hypotheses regarding the origin of life, ensuring each idea has an explicit hypothesis.

**Output from Generation Agent:**
After executing the Generation Agent, we have the following initial set of hypotheses:

1. **Hypothesis 1:** Life originated from a symbiotic relationship between two distinct forms of pre-biotic molecules, one capable of energy storage and the other of genetic information storage.
2. **Hypothesis 2:** The origin of life is linked to the interaction of clay minerals with organic compounds, facilitating the formation of complex structures and catalyzing chemical reactions.
3. **Hypothesis 3:** Life emerged in deep-sea environments around hydrothermal vents, where the unique chemical and thermal conditions allowed for the spontaneous assembly of primitive membranes and genetic systems.
4. **Hypothesis 4:** The genesis of life is tied to the existence of previously unknown, simple organic compounds that acted as precursors to more complex biomolecules, providing a missing link in the origin of life narrative.
5. **Hypothesis 5:** The origin of life is inextricably linked with the presence of extraterrestrial organic compounds delivered to Earth via comets or meteorites, which then served as the foundation for the development of terrestrial life forms.

**Next Steps:**
I will now engage the **Reflection Agent** to evaluate these hypotheses for their novelty, feasibility, and potential to contribute to the scientific understanding of the origin of life. The Reflection Agent will assess each hypothesis based on current scientific knowledge and the criteria of novelty and potential for empirical testing.

Please wait while the Reflection Agent analyzes the hypotheses. The output will be used to decide which hypotheses to proceed with to the next stage of refinement and ranking.
