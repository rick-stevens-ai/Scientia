Please generate really interesting hypothesis that are novel that is do not occur in the literature about how radiation damage to cells results in formation of neoplasms and eventually cancer.  We are looking for new and novel mechanistic hypotheses that could be tested in the lab.   Novel protein protein interactions or novel pathways that connect DNA and cell damage processing to early tumorigensis.
