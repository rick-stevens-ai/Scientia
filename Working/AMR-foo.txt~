The goal of this research is to identify and develop innovative antimicrobial therapies that leverage  
unexplored mechanisms of action, targeting critical microbial pathways and processes not currently     
addressed by existing treatments, thereby providing new solutions to
combat infectious diseases.

We are particularly interested in novel therapies for

Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Haemophilus influenzae 
Escherichia coli
Staphylococcus aureus
