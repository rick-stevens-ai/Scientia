is empirically grounded in established links between m6A and stress responses [Anders 2018; Youn 2019], and SGsâ€™ roles in cancer [Barbieri 2017]. It is theoretically coherent, offering a unified model for dormancy induction. Explanatory and predictive power are high, as the approach can forecast therapy evasion under stress. The idea is falsifiable by demonstrating that disrupting SG-mRNA modification axes impairs dormancy and survival. It is parsimonious, generalizable to other stress-adaptive cancers, and methodologically rigorous with innovative integration of spatial and epitranscriptomic regulation. Future research could explore targeting SG formation or mRNA writers for therapy.
