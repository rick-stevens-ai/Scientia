## Refined Idea (Round 3)

**Title**: ** Ribosome Specialization in Melanoma Drug Resistance

**Key Idea**: ** Specialized ribosome variants in melanoma selectively translate pro-survival transcripts, driving therapy resistance.

**Paragraph 1**: **  
Emerging evidence indicates that ribosomes can vary in their protein and rRNA composition, producing "specialized ribosomes" that preferentially translate specific mRNA subsets [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018]. This idea hypothesizes that resistant melanoma cells upregulate specific ribosomal proteins or rRNA modifications to bias translation toward survival-promoting genes, establishing a new axis of drug resistance. The model is novel in targeting ribosome heterogeneity as a resistance mechanism.

**Paragraph 2**: **  
Ribosome profiling and quantitative proteomics will compare resistant and sensitive melanoma lines. CRISPR/Cas9 editing will disrupt candidate specialized ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL38, RPS25) to assess necessity for resistance. Polysome fractionation and RNA-seq will identify selectively translated mRNAs. In vivo, resistant melanoma models will be engineered to express or silence specialized ribosomal components, testing effects on therapy response. Distinguishing causality versus correlation is the primary challenge, addressed via functional gain- and loss-of-function studies.

**Paragraph 3**: **  
The hypothesis is supported by studies on ribosomal heterogeneity in cancer [Mills 2017]. It is theoretically coherent, adding translational control as a drug resistance layer. Explanatory and predictive power are strong—loss of specialized ribosomes should sensitize cells. The approach is falsifiable and generalizable to other resistant cancers. Methodological rigor is ensured by multi-level validation. The innovation lies in targeting ribosome specialization, with future potential for small-molecule therapeutics.

**Approach**: is falsifiable and generalizable to other resistant cancers. Methodological rigor is ensured by multi-level validation. The innovation lies in targeting ribosome specialization, with future potential for small-molecule therapeutics.

**Key References**: ** [Shi 2017], [Genuth 2018], [Mills 2017]  
**Refinements:** Clarified ribosome specialization targets, expanded in vivo approach, emphasized causality testing, added citation for ribosomal heterogeneity.

**Paragraph 2**: ** The project would employ ribosome profiling and proteomics to compare resistant versus sensitive melanoma lines, mapping ribosomal heterogeneity and translational outputs. CRISPR/Cas9 would target candidate ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL38, RPS25) to test functional necessity. Polysome fractionation followed by RNA-seq will identify selectively translated mRNAs. In vivo, resistant melanoma models would be engineered to express or silence specialized ribosome components to assess therapy response. The main challenge is distinguishing causative specialized ribosomes from byproducts of resistance.

### 1. Empirical Support  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:**  
There is growing evidence for ribosome heterogeneity and its role in translation selectivity, supported by recent studies in cancer biology ([Shi 2017], [Genuth 2018], [Mills 2017]). However, direct empirical evidence linking specialized ribosomes to melanoma drug resistance specifically is lacking, making this hypothesis moderately supported but not fully grounded in direct data.

- Cite additional studies where ribosome specialization confers drug resistance in any cancer context.

---

### 2. Theoretical Coherence  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The hypothesis is internally coherent and logically extends the concept of ribosome specialization to drug resistance, fitting well within current understanding of translational control in cancer.
