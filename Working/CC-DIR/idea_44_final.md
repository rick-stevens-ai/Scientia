# Final Report: Idea 44

## Title

** Unified m6A-Stress Granule Axis in Cancer Dormancy

## One Sentence Summary

** m6A-modified mRNAs sequestered in stress granules promote reversible dormancy in therapy-resistant cancers.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
This idea builds on evidence that m6A epitranscriptomic marks regulate mRNA fate and that stress granules (SGs) modulate cellular survival under stress [Barbieri 2017]. It proposes that in cancer, SGs selectively sequester m6A-modified mRNAs encoding cell cycle and survival regulators, inducing a dormant, therapy-evading state [Anders 2018; Youn 2019]. This model unifies spatial and chemical RNA regulation as a general mechanism for stress-adaptive dormancy across multiple cancers.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
High-throughput m6A-seq and SG isolation will profile the transcriptome of dormant versus cycling cancer cells. CRISPR-based disruption of SG core components and m6A writers/readers will test functional necessity in cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Dormancy will be evaluated by cell cycle status, therapy response, and recovery assays. Orthogonal approaches, such as chemical inhibition of m6A enzymes, will dissect the contribution of modification versus sequestration.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
The hypothesis is empirically grounded in m6A and stress response literature [Anders 2018; Youn 2019]. It is theoretically coherent and provides a parsimonious, testable model for therapy resistance. Explanatory and predictive power are high, and falsifiability is clear via genetic and pharmacological interventions. Methodological rigor is ensured by multi-modal validation. Innovation stems from integrating spatial and epitranscriptomic regulation, with broad implications for therapy-resistant cancers.
