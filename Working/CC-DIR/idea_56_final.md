# Final Report: Idea 56

## Title

** Dissecting Stress Granule and m6A Writer Contributions to Cancer Dormancy

## One Sentence Summary

** Disruption of stress granule assembly and m6A writers impairs dormancy and therapy evasion in cancer.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
This idea proposes that both stress granule (SG) assembly and m6A methylation are necessary for induction of cancer dormancy under stress [Anders 2018; Barbieri 2017]. Disrupting either process impairs the ability of cancer cells to evade therapy, highlighting a dual requirement for spatial and chemical mRNA regulation. The novelty is in dissecting the interplay between these two mechanisms.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
SGs will be isolated from stressed cancer cells; mRNA modifications will be profiled. CRISPR/Cas9 and chemical inhibitors will independently disrupt SG assembly (e.g., G3BP1 knockout) and m6A machinery (METTL3/14). Dormancy and therapy response will be quantified in vitro and in vivo. Orthogonal interventions will clarify the causal hierarchy and potential synergy.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
Evidence supports both SG and m6A contributions to cancer dormancy [Anders 2018; Barbieri 2017]. The model is theoretically coherent and falsifiable. Methodological rigor is ensured by independent and combined perturbations. The approach is innovative, with potential for combinatorial therapeutic targeting.
