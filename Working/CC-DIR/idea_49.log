## Refined Idea (Round 3)

**Title**: ** Ribosomal Protein Variants Biasing Melanoma Survival Translation

**Key Idea**: ** Melanoma therapy resistance is driven by upregulation of specific ribosomal proteins and rRNA modifications that bias translation toward pro-survival genes.

**Paragraph 1**: **  
Ribosome heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a driver of selective mRNA translation [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018]. In melanoma, resistant clones may exploit this by upregulating certain ribosomal proteins or rRNA modifications, shifting translation toward survival and resistance factors. This provides a mechanistic bridge between translational control and therapy evasion, offering new therapeutic entry points.

**Paragraph 2**: **  
Comparative ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry will be applied to sensitive and resistant melanoma cells to identify protein and rRNA changes. CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi will target candidate ribosomal proteins. Polysome fractionation coupled to RNA-seq will reveal translational biases. Functional testing in xenograft models will validate the role of candidate ribosomal variants in therapy resistance.

**Paragraph 3**: **  
Supported by accumulating evidence for ribosomal specialization [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018], the model is theoretically robust, expanding resistance paradigms. It is falsifiable and predictive: disrupting ribosomal variants should sensitize cells. The approach is methodologically rigorous and innovative, with generalizability to other cancers. Future directions include screening for inhibitors of specialized ribosome formation.

**Title**: ** Emerging evidence suggests that ribosomes are n...

**Paragraph 1**: ** Emerging evidence suggests that ribosomes are not homogeneous but can have compositional diversity, leading to "specialized ribosomes" that favor translation of specific mRNA subsets. In melanoma, this idea proposes that resistance to targeted therapies or immunotherapies is achieved by upregulating variant ribosomal proteins or rRNA modifications, biasing translation toward survival-promoting transcripts. This mechanism could explain the persistent survival of resistant clones and highlights translation control as a novel resistance axis [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018].

### Detailed Evaluation

Certainly! Here is a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed research idea "**Ribosomal Protein Variants Biasing Melanoma Survival Translation**" against the 20 scientific criteria, with a score, explanation, and improvement suggestion for each.

---

### 1. Empirical Support
**Score: 6/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The idea is grounded in emerging literature recognizing ribosome heterogeneity and its role in selective translation ([Shi 2017], [Genuth 2018]). However, direct empirical evidence linking specific ribosomal protein variants or rRNA modifications to therapy-resistant melanoma is currently limited.  
**Suggestion:**  
Strengthen the empirical basis by referencing any preliminary data (internal or external) or case studies that suggest ribosomal protein changes in melanoma resistance.

---

### 2. Theoretical Coherence
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The hypothesis is logically coherent and integrates known concepts of translational control, therapy resistance, and ribosomal specialization. The rationale is clearly laid out.  
**Suggestion:**  
Map out the proposed mechanistic pathway in a diagram to further clarify the logical flow from ribosome variation to resistance.

---

### 3. Explanatory Power
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:**  
This hypothesis can explain why some melanoma clones develop resistance through a new, previously underexplored mechanism at the translational level.  
**Suggestion:**  
Discuss how this model compares with or adds to existing explanations for therapy resistance in melanoma.

---

### 4. Predictive Capability
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The hypothesis makes clear, testable predictions: altering specific ribosomal variants will modulate therapy sensitivity.  
**Suggestion:**  
Specify the expected changes in translation profiles or resistance markers to make predictions even more precise.

---

### 5. Falsifiability
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The hypothesis is highly falsifiable; the experiments proposed could clearly refute the role of ribosomal variants if results show no effect.  
**Suggestion:**  
Detail potential negative controls and alternative explanations to further challenge the hypothesis.

---

### 6. Parsimony
**Score: 6/10**  
**Explanation:**  
While the hypothesis is focused, it introduces a new level of complexity (ribosome heterogeneity) to explain resistance.  
**Suggestion:**  
Clarify why existing, simpler models are insufficient, or how this model unifies previously disparate findings.
