### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach

** The project would employ ribosome profiling and proteomics to compare resistant versus sensitive melanoma lines, mapping ribosomal heterogeneity and translational outputs. CRISPR/Cas9 would target candidate ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL38, RPS25) to test functional necessity. Polysome fractionation followed by RNA-seq will identify selectively translated mRNAs. In vivo, resistant melanoma models would be engineered to express or silence specialized ribosome components to assess therapy response. The main challenge is distinguishing causative specialized ribosomes from byproducts of resistance.
