### Detailed Evaluation

It appears that the research idea—**Title**: , expanded reference base. **Approach**: , expanded reference base.—is missing both its title and approach details. As such, a thorough evaluation against the 20 scientific criteria is not possible in its current state.

However, I will provide a template evaluation based on the *absence of information*, demonstrating how each criterion would be scored and what would be needed to improve it. This should help clarify the expectations for the level of detail and content needed in a research proposal for robust evaluation.

---

**Criterion 1 (Empirical Support)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No empirical data or references are provided.  
**Suggestions:** Include a summary of relevant empirical findings and how they relate to your hypothesis.

---

**Criterion 2 (Theoretical Coherence)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** The idea lacks explanation or logical structure.  
**Suggestions:** Clearly articulate the underlying theory and ensure logical consistency.

---

**Criterion 3 (Explanatory Power)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No explanation of phenomena or mechanisms is offered.  
**Suggestions:** Specify what phenomena you aim to explain and how your idea addresses them.

---

**Criterion 4 (Predictive Capability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No testable predictions are outlined.  
**Suggestions:** Formulate predictions that can be empirically tested.

---

**Criterion 5 (Falsifiability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No clear statement of how the idea could be disproven.  
**Suggestions:** Define potential observations or experiments that could refute the hypothesis.

---

**Criterion 6 (Parsimony)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** Simplicity cannot be assessed without content.  
**Suggestions:** Present the core hypothesis concisely and avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

**Criterion 7 (Generalizability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No scope or applicability is described.  
**Suggestions:** Indicate if the hypothesis could apply to multiple cancer types or contexts.

---

**Criterion 8 (Methodological Rigor)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No methods or procedures are described.  
**Suggestions:** Detail the experimental or analytic methods you propose to use.

---

**Criterion 9 (Innovation)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No novel concepts or approaches are presented.  
**Suggestions:** Highlight what makes your hypothesis new and different from existing literature.

---

**Criterion 10 (Problem-Solving Utility)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No practical applications are discussed.  
**Suggestions:** Explain how your research could address current challenges in cancer diagnosis or treatment.

---

**Criterion 11 (Interdisciplinary Impact)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No relevance to other fields is indicated.  
**Suggestions:** Discuss potential implications for other scientific or medical disciplines.

---

**Criterion 12 (Ethical Considerations)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** Ethical aspects are not mentioned.  
**Suggestions:** Address ethical concerns, especially regarding patient data or interventions.

---

**Criterion 13 (Scalability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No information on scalability is available.  
**Suggestions:** Consider how your approach could be expanded from lab to clinical practice.

---

**Criterion 14 (Replicability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No protocols or details are provided to ensure replicability.  
**Suggestions:** Outline clear, reproducible experimental procedures.

---

**Criterion 15 (Theoretical Foundation)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** The idea is not grounded in any described theory.  
**Suggestions:** Link your hypothesis to established scientific principles or models.

---

**Criterion 16 (Technological Feasibility)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No information about required technology or feasibility.  
**Suggestions:** Specify what technologies or resources are needed and their availability.

---

**Criterion 17 (Risk Assessment)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** Risks or limitations are not addressed.  
**Suggestions:** Identify potential challenges and how you plan to mitigate them.

---

**Criterion 18 (Sustainability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** No mention of long-term viability or resource implications.  
**Suggestions:** Discuss how your research could be sustained over time.

---

**Criterion 19 (Societal Relevance)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** Societal benefits or impacts are not discussed.  
**Suggestions:** Articulate how your work could improve health outcomes or benefit society.

---

**Criterion 20 (Future Research Potential)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Rationale:** The idea does not indicate avenues for further research.  
**Suggestions:** Suggest follow-up questions or studies that would stem from your hypothesis.

---

**Summary:**  
This proposal currently lacks sufficient detail for evaluation. Please provide a clear, detailed hypothesis and approach, addressing the above criteria, so a meaningful scientific assessment can be performed.
