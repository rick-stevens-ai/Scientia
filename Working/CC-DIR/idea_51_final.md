## Title

** Gut-Brain Axis Metabolites Reprogramming Tumor Immunity

## One Sentence Summary

** Gut-derived metabolites traverse the BBB to reprogram immune landscapes within brain tumors, affecting progression and response.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
The gut-brain axis has emerged as a critical regulator of neuroimmune interactions [D’Alessandro 2020]. This idea hypothesizes that microbiome-derived metabolites, notably SCFAs and tryptophan derivatives, cross the BBB and reprogram immune cells within brain tumors, shifting the tumor microenvironment toward immune activation or suppression [Colombo 2021]. This creates a new paradigm for non-invasive modulation of neuro-oncology outcomes.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
Murine models with controlled microbiome compositions will be used to quantify brain and tumor levels of gut-derived metabolites via metabolomics. Immune profiling (flow cytometry, scRNA-seq) will map changes in tumor-resident and infiltrating immune cells. Functional studies will manipulate metabolite availability and block BBB transporters to test causality. Main challenges include distinguishing direct immune reprogramming from systemic effects.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
Empirical support for microbiome–brain–tumor crosstalk is increasing [D’Alessandro 2020; Colombo 2021]. The idea is theoretically sound, predictive, and falsifiable through metabolite or transporter blockade. Methodological rigor is ensured by integrated multi-omics and functional interventions. The innovation lies in leveraging the gut-brain axis for tumor immunomodulation, with future potential in microbiome-targeted therapies.
