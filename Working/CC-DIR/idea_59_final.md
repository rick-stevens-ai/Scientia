# Final Report: Idea 59

## Title

** Mechanistic Dissection of Stress Granule-m6A Interactions in Cancer

## One Sentence Summary

** Detailed experimental mapping of stress granule and m6A interactions reveals new resistance mechanisms in cancer.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
This idea aims to dissect the mechanistic interplay between stress granule assembly and m6A mRNA modification in therapy-resistant cancers [Anders 2018; Barbieri 2017; Youn 2019]. By mapping the interactome and functional consequences, it seeks to identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities. The novelty is in the depth of mechanistic analysis and integration of spatial and epitranscriptomic data.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
SGs will be isolated and characterized for mRNA content and modifications. Interactome mapping (CLIP-seq, proteomics) will identify key players. Disruption experiments (CRISPR, RNAi, inhibitors) will assess functional relevance. In vivo validation will confirm translational potential.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
The model is supported by literature [Anders 2018; Barbieri 2017; Youn 2019], theoretically coherent, and falsifiable. Methodological rigor is enhanced by multi-modal analysis. The approach is innovative and opens new research avenues.
