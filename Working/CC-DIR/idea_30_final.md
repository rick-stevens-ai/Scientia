## One Sentence Summary



## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

** Emerging evidence suggests that ribosomes are not homogeneous but can have compositional diversity, leading to "specialized ribosomes" that favor translation of specific mRNA subsets. In melanoma, this idea proposes that resistance to targeted therapies or immunotherapies is achieved by upregulating variant ribosomal proteins or rRNA modifications, biasing translation toward survival-promoting transcripts. This mechanism could explain the persistent survival of resistant clones and highlights translation control as a novel resistance axis [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018].
