## Comparison with Original

### Original Idea (ID: 49)

**Title**: ** Ribosomal Protein Variants Biasing Melanoma Survival Translation

**Key Idea**: ** Melanoma therapy resistance is driven by upregulation of specific ribosomal proteins and rRNA modifications that bias translation toward pro-survival genes.

**Paragraph 1**: **  
Ribosome heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a driver of selective mRNA translation [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018]. In melanoma, resistant clones may exploit this by upregulating certain ribosomal proteins or rRNA modifications, shifting translation toward survival and resistance factors. This provides a mechanistic bridge between translational control and therapy evasion, offering new therapeutic entry points.

**Paragraph 2**: **  
Comparative ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry will be applied to sensitive and resistant melanoma cells to identify protein and rRNA changes. CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi will target candidate ribosomal proteins. Polysome fractionation coupled to RNA-seq will reveal translational biases. Functional testing in xenograft models will validate the role of candidate ribosomal variants in therapy resistance.

**Paragraph 3**: **  
Supported by accumulating evidence for ribosomal specialization [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018], the model is theoretically robust, expanding resistance paradigms. It is falsifiable and predictive: disrupting ribosomal variants should sensitize cells. The approach is methodologically rigorous and innovative, with generalizability to other cancers. Future directions include screening for inhibitors of specialized ribosome formation.

**Approach**: is methodologically rigorous and innovative, with generalizability to other cancers. Future directions include screening for inhibitors of specialized ribosome formation.

**Key References**: ** [Shi 2017], [Genuth 2018]  
**Refinements:** Expanded methodological detail, clarified mechanistic focus, integrated in vivo testing.

### Detailed Evaluation

Certainly! However, to thoroughly evaluate the idea, I require more details about the hypothesis or research plan itself—currently, you’ve only provided a placeholder title (“Untitled Idea”) and references. Since no actual hypothesis or experimental design is described, I'll make the evaluation based on the absence of substantive content, as would be standard in such a peer review scenario.

---

### 1. Empirical Support
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** No hypothesis or data is provided, so there is nothing to evaluate for consistency with existing evidence or data.  
**Suggestion:** Clearly state the novel hypothesis and summarize any preliminary data or indirect supporting evidence.

---

### 2. Theoretical Coherence
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** Without a specific idea or logical outline, internal consistency and clarity cannot be assessed.  
**Suggestion:** Articulate the central hypothesis and explain the underlying logic connecting relevant concepts.

---

### 3. Explanatory Power
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** No explanation of phenomena is possible without the idea itself.  
**Suggestion:** Describe what phenomena your hypothesis aims to explain in cancer diagnosis/treatment.

---

### 4. Predictive Capability
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** No predictions can be made in the absence of a hypothesis.  
**Suggestion:** Specify what concrete, testable predictions your idea makes.

---

### 5. Falsifiability
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** The absence of a hypothesis means it cannot be deemed falsifiable.  
**Suggestion:** Frame the idea so that it can be proven false through experiment.

---

### 6. Parsimony
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** Simplicity cannot be judged, as there is no content.  
**Suggestion:** Ensure the hypothesis is as simple as possible while accounting for key factors.

---

### 7. Generalizability
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** Applicability beyond the initial context cannot be assessed.  
**Suggestion:** Indicate whether and how the hypothesis might apply to multiple cancer types or broader biomedical contexts.

---

### 8. Methodological Rigor
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** No methods or experimental procedures are described.  
**Suggestion:** Outline a detailed, robust experimental plan for validation.

---

### 9. Innovation
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** Without any hypothesis, originality or advancement cannot be determined.  
**Suggestion:** Explicitly state how the idea differs from or advances beyond current literature.

---

### 10. Problem-Solving Utility
**Score: 1/10**  
**Explanation:** No practical application can be inferred.  
**Suggestion:** Define how the idea could improve diagnosis or treatment of hard-to-treat cancers.
