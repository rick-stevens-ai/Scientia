## Title

** Stress Granule-Associated m6A Modifications Driving Pancreatic Cancer Dormancy

## One Sentence Summary

** Stress granules in pancreatic cancer cells promote dormancy and therapy evasion via selective m6A modification of sequestered mRNAs.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Pancreatic cancer cells frequently encounter metabolic and therapeutic stress, prompting the assembly of stress granules (SGs)â€”membraneless organelles that sequester mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins [Barbieri 2017]. This idea proposes that within SGs, specific mRNAs acquire dynamic N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications, altering their stability and translation, thereby promoting a reversible dormant state [Anders 2018; Youn 2019]. The novelty is in coupling spatial mRNA sequestration with epitranscriptomic remodeling as a driver of adaptive drug resistance.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
Experiments will isolate SGs from stressed pancreatic cancer cells, profile mRNA modifications (m6A-seq, LC-MS/MS), and use CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt SG assembly (G3BP1) or m6A writers (METTL3/14). Effects on dormancy and therapy response will be assayed both in vitro and in xenograft models. Single-molecule RNA FISH and live-cell imaging will validate spatial sequestration and translational suppression. To disentangle sequestration versus modification effects, orthogonal interventions (e.g., chemical inhibitors of methyltransferases) will be combined with genetic models.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
The hypothesis is empirically anchored in emerging links between m6A, stress response, and cancer dormancy [Anders 2018; Youn 2019]. The model provides explanatory and predictive power for stress-induced therapy evasion and is falsifiable by disrupting the SG-m6A axis. The approach is generalizable to other stress-adaptive cancers, methodologically rigorous, and innovative in integrating spatial and chemical regulation of mRNA. Future research could explore therapeutic targeting of SG dynamics or m6A modification machinery.
