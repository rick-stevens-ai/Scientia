# Final Report: Idea 57

## Title

** Selective Survival Translation via Specialized Ribosomes in Melanoma

## One Sentence Summary

** Resistant melanoma cells deploy specialized ribosomes to preferentially translate pro-survival gene networks.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Therapy-resistant melanoma cells may assemble specialized ribosomes that selectively translate mRNAs encoding survival and resistance factors [Shi 2017]. This idea identifies ribosomal heterogeneity as a central driver of translational reprogramming and resistance. The novelty is in mapping gene networks engaged by specialized ribosomes.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
Ribosome profiling and polysome RNA-seq will identify mRNAs preferentially associated with specialized ribosomes in resistant cells. CRISPR/Cas9 will target key ribosomal proteins. Functional assays will test the impact of disrupting specialized ribosomes on resistance.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
Supported by recent literature [Shi 2017], the idea is theoretically robust and falsifiable. Explanatory and predictive power are high. The approach is methodologically rigorous and innovative, offering new drug targets.
