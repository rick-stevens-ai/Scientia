## Title

** Pancreatic cancer cells frequently encounter me...

## One Sentence Summary



## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

** Pancreatic cancer cells frequently encounter metabolic and therapeutic stress, leading to the assembly of stress granules (SGs), which are membraneless organelles that transiently store mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. This idea posits that, within SGs, specific mRNAs undergo dynamic epitranscriptomic modifications such as m6A methylation, altering their stability, localization, and translation. These modifications foster a reversible dormant state, enabling tumor cells to evade therapies targeting actively cycling cells. The novelty lies in implicating stress granule-associated mRNA modification as a mechanistic driver of adaptive dormancy and resistance, integrating spatial RNA sequestration with chemical modification in therapeutic evasion [Anders 2018; Barbieri 2017].
