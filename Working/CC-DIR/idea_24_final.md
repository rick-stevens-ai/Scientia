## One Sentence Summary



## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach

** To address causality, experiments should isolate SGs from pancreatic cancer cells under stress and profile mRNA modifications via high-throughput techniques (m6A-seq, LC-MS/MS). Disruption of SG assembly (e.g., G3BP1 knockdown) or epitranscriptomic writers (e.g., METTL3/14 CRISPR) will test effects on dormancy and therapy response in vitro and in xenograft models. Single-molecule RNA FISH and live-cell imaging will validate spatial sequestration and translation suppression. The challenge will be separating the effects of sequestration from modification, which can be addressed by orthogonal interventions.
