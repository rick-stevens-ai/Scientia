## One Sentence Summary



## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

** The gut-brain axis is increasingly recognized for its impact on neuroimmune function, yet the direct effect of gut-derived metabolites on brain tumor microenvironments is underexplored. This idea hypothesizes that specific short-chain fatty acids or other metabolites produced by the gut microbiota can permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and alter immune cell phenotypes within brain tumors, potentially shifting the immunosuppressive landscape and influencing tumor progression [D'Alessandro 2020]. The novelty lies in linking microbiome metabolism to brain tumor immune modulation via BBB-transiting molecules.
