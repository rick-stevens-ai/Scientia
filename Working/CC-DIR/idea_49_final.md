## Title

** Ribosomal Protein Variants Biasing Melanoma Survival Translation

## One Sentence Summary

** Melanoma therapy resistance is driven by upregulation of specific ribosomal proteins and rRNA modifications that bias translation toward pro-survival genes.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Ribosome heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a driver of selective mRNA translation [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018]. In melanoma, resistant clones may exploit this by upregulating certain ribosomal proteins or rRNA modifications, shifting translation toward survival and resistance factors. This provides a mechanistic bridge between translational control and therapy evasion, offering new therapeutic entry points.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
Comparative ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry will be applied to sensitive and resistant melanoma cells to identify protein and rRNA changes. CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi will target candidate ribosomal proteins. Polysome fractionation coupled to RNA-seq will reveal translational biases. Functional testing in xenograft models will validate the role of candidate ribosomal variants in therapy resistance.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
Supported by accumulating evidence for ribosomal specialization [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018], the model is theoretically robust, expanding resistance paradigms. It is falsifiable and predictive: disrupting ribosomal variants should sensitize cells. The approach is methodologically rigorous and innovative, with generalizability to other cancers. Future directions include screening for inhibitors of specialized ribosome formation.
