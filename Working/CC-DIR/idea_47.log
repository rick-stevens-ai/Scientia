## New Idea from Significant Change (Round 3)

This idea represents a significant change from Idea 33.

**Title**: ** Functional Ribosome Heterogeneity in Melanoma Therapeutic Escape

**Key Idea**: ** Ribosomal protein composition shifts promote selective translation of resistance-related mRNAs in melanoma, driving therapeutic escape.

**Paragraph 1**: **  
Cancer cells may adapt to therapy by altering their ribosome protein composition, creating a pool of "specialized ribosomes" optimized for translating resistance-linked mRNAs [Shi 2017; Mills 2017]. In melanoma, this adaptive translation is hypothesized to underlie the emergence of drug-resistant phenotypes, with specific ribosomal proteins or rRNA modifications facilitating selective mRNA engagement. The novelty is the focus on ribosome function as a modifiable resistance driver.

**Paragraph 2**: **  
Ribosome profiling and CRISPR-mediated perturbation of candidate ribosomal proteins will be undertaken in therapy-resistant and sensitive melanoma cells. Polysome RNA-seq will identify selectively translated mRNAs. Functional resistance assays will test the necessity of candidate ribosomal proteins for survival under therapy. The main challenge is establishing direct causality, addressed via loss- and gain-of-function studies and rescue experiments.

**Paragraph 3**: **  
The idea is empirically supported by findings of ribosomal heterogeneity in cancer [Mills 2017]. Theoretically, it expands resistance models to the translational level with strong explanatory and predictive power. Falsifiability is ensured via CRISPR perturbation. The approach is methodologically robust, generalizable, and innovative, opening the door to translation-targeted therapies. Future research could screen for drugs disrupting specialized ribosomes.

**Key References**: ** [Shi 2017], [Mills 2017]

### Detailed Evaluation

**1. Empirical Support**  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The concept of ribosome heterogeneity and its functional impact in cancer has emerging support, particularly in other cancer types. However, direct evidence specifically linking ribosomal shifts to therapeutic escape in melanoma is limited to analogies and indirect findings ([Shi 2017], [Mills 2017]).  
**Suggestions:**  
Cite more preliminary data or pilot studies specifically in melanoma. Consider including proteomics or ribosome profiling data from patient samples.

---

**2. Theoretical Coherence**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The hypothesis is logically constructed and expands current resistance paradigms to the translational machinery, which is a coherent extension of molecular oncology frameworks.  
**Suggestions:**  
Further clarify the mechanistic links between specific ribosomal proteins and resistance pathways, possibly by mapping known resistance mRNAs to identified ribosome variants.

---

**3. Explanatory Power**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The hypothesis could account for cases of resistance unexplained by genetic or transcriptomic alterations, offering a new explanatory layer in melanoma adaptation.  
**Suggestions:**  
Expand on how this mechanism integrates (or competes) with known resistance mechanisms, such as signaling rewiring or epigenetic changes.

---

**4. Predictive Capability**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:**  
Testable predictions are clear: altering ribosomal composition should modulate resistance. This enables direct experimental validation.  
**Suggestions:**  
Make explicit predictions about which ribosomal proteins or modifications are most critical, and relate these to patient outcomes.

---

**5. Falsifiability**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:**  
Loss/gain-of-function CRISPR experiments and rescue assays provide strong means to potentially disprove the hypothesis.  
**Suggestions:**  
Clarify key negative controls and define what results would clearly refute the hypothesis.

---

**6. Parsimony**  
**Score: 6/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The idea is somewhat complex, introducing a new regulatory layer. While elegant, it may be less parsimonious than gene-centric models.  
**Suggestions:**  
Consider how this model interfaces with simpler explanations, and address possible redundancy with known resistance factors.

---

**7. Generalizability**  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:**  
While focused on melanoma, ribosome heterogeneity could plausibly underlie resistance in other cancers.  
**Suggestions:**  
Propose pilot studies in other hard-to-treat cancers, or discuss how findings may translate.

---

**8. Methodological Rigor**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The proposed experiments (ribosome profiling, CRISPR, polysome RNA-seq) are state-of-the-art and appropriate.  
**Suggestions:**  
Include orthogonal validation (e.g., mass spectrometry) and ensure robust statistical analysis plans.

---

**9. Innovation**  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The hypothesis is highly novel, moving beyond conventional gene/protein targets to ribosomal function as a driver of resistance.  
**Suggestions:**  
Emphasize aspects not previously explored in the literature and highlight the translational potential.

---

**10. Problem-Solving Utility**  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:**  
If validated, targeting ribosomal heterogeneity could offer new therapeutic strategies for drug-resistant melanoma.  
**Suggestions:**  
Propose concrete therapeutic interventions, such as small molecules disrupting specific ribosome populations.

---

**11. Interdisciplinary Impact**  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:**  
The hypothesis could influence molecular oncology, translational medicine, structural biology, and pharmacology.  
**Suggestions:**  
Engage or cite collaborators from these fields to strengthen cross-disciplinary ties.

---

**12. Ethical Considerations**  
**Score: 8/10**
