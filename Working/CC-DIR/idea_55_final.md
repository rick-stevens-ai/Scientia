# Final Report: Idea 55

## Title

** Metabolomic and Immunophenotypic Profiling in Microbiome-Tumor Crosstalk

## One Sentence Summary

** Integrated metabolomics and immune profiling reveal microbiome-driven modulators of brain tumor immunity.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
This idea integrates metabolomics and immunophenotyping to systematically identify microbiome-derived metabolites that alter brain tumor immune environments [Colombo 2021]. By mapping the interplay between gut flora, metabolite transfer, and CNS immune responses, it seeks to uncover novel modulators of tumor progression and therapeutic response. The novelty is in the systems-level, multimodal approach.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
Murine brain tumor models with manipulated gut microbiota will undergo CSF/tumor metabolomics and immune cell profiling (flow cytometry, scRNA-seq). BBB permeability assays will confirm metabolite transfer. Functional interventions (e.g., metabolite supplementation) will test causality. Challenges include resolving the complexity of metabolite-immune interactions and ensuring specificity.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
Supported by recent microbiomeâ€“brain tumor literature [Colombo 2021], the model is theoretically sound and falsifiable. Explanatory and predictive potential are high; methodological rigor is ensured by integrated multi-omics. The approach is innovative and generalizable, with future potential for identifying actionable targets.
