## Comparison with Original

### Original Idea (ID: 61)

**Title**: ### REFINED AND STRENGTHENED IDEAS

**Key Idea**: ** Specialized ribosome isoforms in melanoma selectively promote translation of pro-survival transcripts, constituting a core axis of therapy resistance.

**Approach**: is falsifiable, generalizable to other cancers, and methodologically rigorous via multi-level validation. Innovation lies in targeting ribosome isoform regulation, with future potential for the development of isoform-specific ribosome inhibitors [Simsek 2017].

### Detailed Evaluation

Certainly! Since the idea provided is “Untitled Idea” with only key references listed and **no actual hypothesis or description of a research plan**, my evaluation will be based on the absence of substantive content. This will be reflected in the scores and suggestions.

---

### 1. Empirical Support  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No hypothesis or research plan is provided, so it is impossible to judge empirical support. The references alone do not constitute evidence for a novel idea.  
**Suggestions:** Clearly state the hypothesis and outline how it connects to existing empirical findings, citing relevant data.

---

### 2. Theoretical Coherence  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** Without an articulated idea, there is no theoretical structure to assess for coherence or logical consistency.  
**Suggestions:** Provide a well-defined hypothesis and explain the theoretical framework or rationale underpinning it.

---

### 3. Explanatory Power  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No mechanism, model, or explanation is described, so explanatory power cannot be evaluated.  
**Suggestions:** Explain what phenomena the hypothesis seeks to explain and how it does so.

---

### 4. Predictive Capability  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No predictions or testable outcomes are indicated.  
**Suggestions:** Include specific, testable predictions that would arise if the hypothesis is correct.

---

### 5. Falsifiability  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** The absence of a concrete hypothesis means it cannot be judged for falsifiability.  
**Suggestions:** Articulate the hypothesis in a way that allows for clear experimental refutation.

---

### 6. Parsimony  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** Parsimony cannot be assessed without a hypothesis or proposed mechanism.  
**Suggestions:** When developing your idea, strive for simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

### 7. Generalizability  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No scope or context is provided, making generalizability impossible to judge.  
**Suggestions:** Define the specific cancer types targeted and discuss potential broader applications.

---

### 8. Methodological Rigor  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No methods are described.  
**Suggestions:** Outline a detailed experimental plan, including controls, sample sizes, and analysis methods.

---

### 9. Innovation  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** Nothing novel is described; only references are listed.  
**Suggestions:** Clearly articulate what is new and unique about your hypothesis compared to existing work.

---

### 10. Problem-Solving Utility  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No information is provided on how the proposed idea addresses challenges in cancer diagnosis or treatment.  
**Suggestions:** Explain how your hypothesis could improve diagnosis or therapy of hard-to-treat cancers.

---

### 11. Interdisciplinary Impact  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** The potential for cross-disciplinary relevance cannot be evaluated.  
**Suggestions:** Identify possible intersections with other scientific fields (e.g., immunology, bioinformatics) in your research plan.

---

### 12. Ethical Considerations  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No ethical dimensions or issues are mentioned.  
**Suggestions:** Discuss ethical implications, especially in clinical or translational research contexts.

---

### 13. Scalability  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** Scalability (across populations, settings, or scales) is not addressed.  
**Suggestions:** Consider how your approach could extend to different cancer types or clinical settings.

---

### 14. Replicability  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** Replicability cannot be judged in the absence of a described experimental approach.  
**Suggestions:** Design studies with clear protocols and sufficient detail for independent replication.

---

### 15. Theoretical Foundation  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** The references suggest some foundation, but the lack of an idea means this cannot be properly assessed.  
**Suggestions:** Explicitly link your hypothesis to established knowledge, referencing key studies.

---

### 16. Technological Feasibility  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No techniques or technologies are described.  
**Suggestions:** Specify the required technologies and discuss their current feasibility.

---

### 17. Risk Assessment  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No risks or limitations are discussed.  
**Suggestions:** Identify possible pitfalls, limitations, or safety concerns in your proposed work.

---

### 18. Sustainability  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No information is provided on resource use or long-term viability.  
**Suggestions:** Consider sustainable practices in experimental design and resource allocation.

---

### 19. Societal Relevance  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** The potential benefit to society cannot be evaluated in the absence of an idea.  
**Suggestions:** Articulate the possible impact of your hypothesis on society, patients, and healthcare.

---

### 20. Future Research Potential  
**Score: 1/10**  
**Rationale:** No new research avenues are proposed.  
**Suggestions:** Discuss how your hypothesis could open up further research questions or directions.

---

## Summary  
**Overall, each criterion received a 1/10 due to the absence of a stated hypothesis or research plan.**  
**Key Recommendation:** Please provide a clear, novel hypothesis related to challenging cancers, along with an outline of how it can be experimentally tested. This will allow for a meaningful evaluation across all scientific criteria.
