## Title

** Stress Granule Epitranscriptomic Remodeling in Pancreatic Cancer

## One Sentence Summary

** Stress granules orchestrate epitranscriptomic mRNA modifications that enable adaptive dormancy and therapy evasion in pancreatic cancer.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Pancreatic cancer cells form stress granules (SGs) under adverse conditions, sequestering and modifying mRNAs to promote cell survival [Barbieri 2017]. This idea suggests that SGs act as hubs for epitranscriptomic remodeling, specifically m6A methylation, stabilizing transcripts critical for dormancy and resistance [Anders 2018; Youn 2019]. The novelty lies in integrating spatial sequestration with dynamic mRNA modification as a resistance mechanism.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
SGs will be isolated from stressed pancreatic cancer cells, and their mRNA content and modifications profiled via m6A-seq and LC-MS/MS. Disruption of SG assembly (G3BP1 knockdown) or m6A machinery (METTL3/14) will test effects on dormancy and survival, both in vitro and in xenograft models. Live-cell imaging and single-molecule RNA FISH will validate the spatial and functional relationship between SGs and m6A-modified mRNAs. Challenges include dissecting direct versus indirect effects, which will be addressed via orthogonal interventions.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
The hypothesis is well supported by literature linking m6A, stress response, and SGs in cancer [Anders 2018; Barbieri 2017]. It is parsimonious and theoretically coherent, explaining adaptive dormancy under stress. Predictive and explanatory power are high, and the approach is falsifiable by disrupting SG-m6A axes. Methodological rigor and innovation are ensured by integrating spatial and epitranscriptomic data. Future studies could target SG or m6A machinery in therapy-resistant cancers.
