## Title

** Extracellular Vesicle-Mediated Intercellular Communication in Tumor Immune Evasion

## One Sentence Summary

** Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) modulate local and systemic immune responses to facilitate immune evasion and therapy resistance.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Cancer cells release a variety of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, which carry proteins, RNAs, and lipids capable of profoundly influencing the tumor microenvironment and systemic immunity [Whiteside 2016]. This idea posits that tumor-derived EVs deliver immunosuppressive signals and regulatory RNAs to both local and distant immune cells, reprogramming their phenotype toward tolerance or exhaustion. The novelty lies in the focus on EV-mediated, non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of immune modulation as a unifying axis for therapy resistance across cancer types.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
The hypothesis will be tested by isolating EVs from therapy-resistant and sensitive tumor models (pancreatic, melanoma, glioma) and characterizing their cargo (proteomics, small RNA-seq, lipidomics). In vitro, EVs will be applied to primary immune cells and assessed for phenotypic and functional changes (cytokine production, exhaustion marker expression, cytotoxicity). In vivo, EV-depleted or EV-augmented tumor models will be used to determine effects on immune landscape and therapy response. Key challenges include distinguishing EV-specific effects from soluble mediators and tracking EV targets in vivo, which will be addressed using EV labeling and genetic models.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
EV-mediated immune modulation is supported by accumulating evidence [Whiteside 2016; Hoshino 2015]. The hypothesis is theoretically coherent, offering high explanatory power for widespread immune evasion. Predictive capability is robust, and the approach is falsifiable via genetic or pharmacological EV blockade. Methodological rigor is ensured by multi-omics profiling and in vivo tracking. The innovation is in targeting the EV–immune axis for immunotherapy, with potential for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention.
