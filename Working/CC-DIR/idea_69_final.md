## Key Ideas and Implementation

This section provides a detailed explanation of the key ideas and how they could be implemented or tested.

### Implementation and Testing Approach

is theoretically coherent, highly explanatory, and predictive—blocking metabolite transfer or immune reprogramming should alter outcomes. The hypothesis is falsifiable and generalizable across CNS tumors. Methodological rigor is ensured via multi-omics and functional manipulations. Innovation lies in targeting the microbiome–immune axis for CNS tumor therapy [Hsiao 2021].
