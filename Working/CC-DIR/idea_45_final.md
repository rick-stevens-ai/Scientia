## Title

** Ribosome Specialization in Melanoma Drug Resistance

## One Sentence Summary

** Specialized ribosome variants in melanoma selectively translate pro-survival transcripts, driving therapy resistance.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Emerging evidence indicates that ribosomes can vary in their protein and rRNA composition, producing "specialized ribosomes" that preferentially translate specific mRNA subsets [Shi 2017; Genuth 2018]. This idea hypothesizes that resistant melanoma cells upregulate specific ribosomal proteins or rRNA modifications to bias translation toward survival-promoting genes, establishing a new axis of drug resistance. The model is novel in targeting ribosome heterogeneity as a resistance mechanism.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
Ribosome profiling and quantitative proteomics will compare resistant and sensitive melanoma lines. CRISPR/Cas9 editing will disrupt candidate specialized ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL38, RPS25) to assess necessity for resistance. Polysome fractionation and RNA-seq will identify selectively translated mRNAs. In vivo, resistant melanoma models will be engineered to express or silence specialized ribosomal components, testing effects on therapy response. Distinguishing causality versus correlation is the primary challenge, addressed via functional gain- and loss-of-function studies.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
The hypothesis is supported by studies on ribosomal heterogeneity in cancer [Mills 2017]. It is theoretically coherent, adding translational control as a drug resistance layer. Explanatory and predictive power are strongâ€”loss of specialized ribosomes should sensitize cells. The approach is falsifiable and generalizable to other resistant cancers. Methodological rigor is ensured by multi-level validation. The innovation lies in targeting ribosome specialization, with future potential for small-molecule therapeutics.
