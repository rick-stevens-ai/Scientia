## Refined Idea (Round 4)

**Title**: Untitled Idea

**Key References**: ** [Anders 2018], [Barbieri 2017], [Youn 2019], [He 2019]

## Comparison with Original

### Original Idea (ID: 57)

**Title**: ** Selective Survival Translation via Specialized Ribosomes in Melanoma

**Key Idea**: ** Resistant melanoma cells deploy specialized ribosomes to preferentially translate pro-survival gene networks.

**Paragraph 1**: **  
Therapy-resistant melanoma cells may assemble specialized ribosomes that selectively translate mRNAs encoding survival and resistance factors [Shi 2017]. This idea identifies ribosomal heterogeneity as a central driver of translational reprogramming and resistance. The novelty is in mapping gene networks engaged by specialized ribosomes.

**Paragraph 2**: **  
Ribosome profiling and polysome RNA-seq will identify mRNAs preferentially associated with specialized ribosomes in resistant cells. CRISPR/Cas9 will target key ribosomal proteins. Functional assays will test the impact of disrupting specialized ribosomes on resistance.

**Paragraph 3**: **  
Supported by recent literature [Shi 2017], the idea is theoretically robust and falsifiable. Explanatory and predictive power are high. The approach is methodologically rigorous and innovative, offering new drug targets.

**Approach**: is methodologically rigorous and innovative, offering new drug targets.

**Key References**: ** [Shi 2017]  
**Refinements:** Focused on mapping specialized ribosome gene networks, clarified intervention strategy.

### Detailed Evaluation

Certainly! Based on your prompt, it appears that the "Untitled Idea" lacks any substantive detailsâ€”no hypothesis, concept, or research plan is provided except for a title and references. I will evaluate this lack of information against each criterion, assuming that the only content is the absence of a specific idea.

---

**Criterion 1 (Empirical Support)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** No hypothesis or experimental design is provided, so there can be no assessment of empirical support.  
**Suggestions:** Clearly define the hypothesis and provide preliminary evidence or rationale referencing the listed papers.

---

**Criterion 2 (Theoretical Coherence)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Without a described theory or hypothesis, logical consistency cannot be evaluated.  
**Suggestions:** Articulate the underlying theoretical framework and explain how it is internally consistent.

---

**Criterion 3 (Explanatory Power)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** No phenomena are targeted or explained due to the absence of a stated hypothesis.  
**Suggestions:** Specify the phenomena the idea seeks to explain, and describe how it accounts for them.

---

**Criterion 4 (Predictive Capability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** No predictions can be made without an explicit hypothesis or mechanism.  
**Suggestions:** Formulate testable predictions that follow from the hypothesis.

---

**Criterion 5 (Falsifiability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** No claim is made, so nothing can be falsified.  
**Suggestions:** Clearly state the hypothesis and include ways it could be empirically disproven.

---

**Criterion 6 (Parsimony)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Cannot be assessed, as there is no model or explanation to judge for simplicity.  
**Suggestions:** When developing the hypothesis, aim for simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

**Criterion 7 (Generalizability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Generalizability cannot be evaluated in the absence of a defined scope or content.  
**Suggestions:** Define the intended scope and discuss how the idea could apply to other cancer types or contexts.

---

**Criterion 8 (Methodological Rigor)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** No methods are described, preventing assessment of scientific rigor.  
**Suggestions:** Propose a detailed experimental plan, including controls, measurement techniques, and statistical analyses.

---

**Criterion 9 (Innovation)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** There is no content to judge for novelty or originality.  
**Suggestions:** Craft a hypothesis that is clearly distinct from existing literature, possibly leveraging interdisciplinary insights.

---

**Criterion 10 (Problem-Solving Utility)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** No problem is identified or addressed.  
**Suggestions:** State the specific cancer research challenge the idea aims to solve and how it would do so.

---

**Criterion 11 (Interdisciplinary Impact)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Relevance to other fields is impossible to assess without a substantive idea.  
**Suggestions:** Highlight intersections with other disciplines (e.g., immunology, bioinformatics, material science).

---

**Criterion 12 (Ethical Considerations)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Ethical implications cannot be determined without a research plan.  
**Suggestions:** Address potential ethical concerns related to the hypothesis or experimental design.

---

**Criterion 13 (Scalability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Scalability cannot be judged with no implementation details.  
**Suggestions:** Discuss how the proposed research could be scaled to larger studies or clinical use.

---

**Criterion 14 (Replicability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** No methods or protocols are given, so reproducibility cannot be assessed.  
**Suggestions:** Provide detailed protocols and data-sharing plans to enhance replicability.

---

**Criterion 15 (Theoretical Foundation)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** No connection to established scientific knowledge is made, other than listing references.  
**Suggestions:** Explicitly link the idea to foundational theories or findings in cancer biology.

---

**Criterion 16 (Technological Feasibility)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Feasibility cannot be assessed in the absence of a proposal.  
**Suggestions:** Outline the required technologies and evaluate their readiness for your proposed research.

---

**Criterion 17 (Risk Assessment)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Risks and limitations are not described.  
**Suggestions:** Anticipate potential scientific, technical, and ethical risks, and propose mitigation strategies.

---

**Criterion 18 (Sustainability)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Sustainability of the approach cannot be considered without knowledge of the idea or methods.  
**Suggestions:** Consider resource requirements and environmental impact when formulating your research plan.

---

**Criterion 19 (Societal Relevance)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** Societal impact cannot be evaluated with no context or content.  
**Suggestions:** Relate the hypothesis to societal benefits, such as improved cancer diagnosis or treatment.

---

**Criterion 20 (Future Research Potential)**  
Score: 1/10  
**Explanation:** No idea is proposed, so potential to inspire further research is absent.  
**Suggestions:** Design the hypothesis to open new avenues for investigation and interdisciplinary collaboration.

---

**Overall Summary:**  
This evaluation underscores the need for a clearly articulated, novel hypothesis, a rationale based on current literature, and a detailed plan for experimental validation. Please provide a specific research idea or hypothesis for a meaningful evaluation across these scientific criteria.
