## Comparison with Original

### Original Idea (ID: 58)

**Title**: ** Targeting Cancer Resistance via Ribosome Subtype Inhibition

**Key Idea**: ** Cancer therapy resistance is driven by ribosomal heterogeneity, which can be targeted via subtype-specific inhibitors.

**Paragraph 1**: **  
Ribosomal heterogeneity underlies selective translation of resistance-promoting genes in cancer [Mills 2017]. This idea proposes that small molecules targeting specific ribosome subtypes can re-sensitize resistant tumors. The novelty is in the therapeutic targeting of translational machinery heterogeneity.

**Paragraph 2**: **  
Ribosome profiling and proteomics will map ribosome subtype composition in resistant cancers. High-throughput screening will identify inhibitors of candidate ribosome subtypes. Functional validation will be performed in vitro and in xenograft models.

**Paragraph 3**: **  
Supported by ribosomal heterogeneity evidence [Mills 2017], the model is theoretically sound, falsifiable, and innovative. The approach is generalizable and methodologically robust, with future drug development potential.

**Approach**: is generalizable and methodologically robust, with future drug development potential.

**Key References**: ** [Mills 2017]  
**Refinements:** Emphasized inhibitor screening, clarified therapeutic focus.

### Detailed Evaluation

Certainly! Here is a detailed evaluation of the research idea (“m6A-seq, SG isolation, CRISPR/chemical disruption, multi-cancer comparison, mathematical modeling”) against the specified 20 scientific criteria, each with a score, rationale, and suggestions for improvement.

---

### 1. Empirical Support
**Score: 4/10**  
**Rationale:** The use of m6A-seq, stress granule (SG) isolation, CRISPR/chemical disruption, and mathematical modeling are individually established methods, but their integration in this specific context (novel cancer hypothesis, especially for hard-to-treat cancers) lacks direct empirical precedent.  
**Suggestions:** Conduct a pilot study or systematic review to gather preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility and relevance of integrating these techniques in cancer research.

---

### 2. Theoretical Coherence  
**Score: 6/10**  
**Rationale:** The combination of epitranscriptomic profiling (m6A), stress granule dynamics, and genetic/chemical perturbation is conceptually sound, but the hypothesis linking these elements is not fully elaborated.  
**Suggestions:** Develop a clear mechanistic model explaining how these components interact in the context of cancer biology.

---

### 3. Explanatory Power  
**Score: 5/10**  
**Rationale:** The approach could potentially explain novel aspects of RNA regulation in cancer, but the explanatory targets (e.g., specific cancer phenotypes) are not defined.  
**Suggestions:** Explicitly state what phenomena or cancer behaviors the hypothesis aims to explain.

---

### 4. Predictive Capability  
**Score: 5/10**  
**Rationale:** Predictive power is possible if the mathematical modeling is robust, but no specific, testable predictions are articulated.  
**Suggestions:** Formulate clear, falsifiable predictions that can be experimentally validated using the proposed methods.

---

### 5. Falsifiability  
**Score: 6/10**  
**Rationale:** If the hypothesis is that m6A-modified RNAs in stress granules affect cancer resilience, this can be tested. However, the core hypothesis needs clearer articulation to assess falsifiability.  
**Suggestions:** Specify the main hypothesis in a way that experimental outcomes could clearly support or refute it.

---

### 6. Parsimony  
**Score: 4/10**  
**Rationale:** The approach is methodologically complex with many moving parts, which may obscure causal inference and reduce elegance.  
**Suggestions:** Streamline the methodology, focusing on the minimal set of techniques required to test the hypothesis.

---

### 7. Generalizability  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Rationale:** By proposing a multi-cancer comparison, the idea aims for general applicability, which is a strength.  
**Suggestions:** Ensure that chosen cancers represent diverse biological backgrounds to test generalizability robustly.

---

### 8. Methodological Rigor  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Rationale:** Each technique (m6A-seq, SG isolation, CRISPR) is methodologically rigorous when well-executed, but integrating them increases complexity and risk of technical artifacts.  
**Suggestions:** Design rigorous controls and validation steps for each methodological component.

---

### 9. Innovation  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Rationale:** The synthesis of epitranscriptomic profiling, SG biology, and CRISPR perturbation for multi-cancer analysis is highly novel and not widely explored.  
**Suggestions:** Highlight unique aspects and potential breakthroughs, and clearly differentiate from existing studies.

---

### 10. Problem-Solving Utility  
**Score: 6/10**  
**Rationale:** If successful, could provide new diagnostic and therapeutic targets, but the practical pathway to application is not clarified.  
**Suggestions:** Map out how findings could lead to clinical interventions or improvements in diagnosis.

---

### 11. Interdisciplinary Impact  
**Score: 8/10**  
**Rationale:** The approach bridges molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, and mathematical modeling, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.  
**Suggestions:** Engage experts from each discipline early in the project design.

---

### 12. Ethical Considerations  
**Score: 6/10**  
**Rationale:** Standard ethical considerations for genetic and chemical perturbation in cancer research apply, with no extraordinary risks identified.  
**Suggestions:** Ensure robust informed consent and safety protocols, especially if moving toward clinical samples.

---

### 13. Scalability  
**Score: 6/10**  
**Rationale:** Techniques are scalable in principle, but resource intensity (cost, time, expertise) may limit broad application.  
**Suggestions:** Explore automation, high-throughput approaches, or prioritization strategies for initial studies.

---

### 14. Replicability  
**Score: 5/10**  
**Rationale:** The complexity of the workflow can hinder reproducibility, especially across labs with varying expertise.  
**Suggestions:** Standardize protocols and develop comprehensive methodological documentation.

---

### 15. Theoretical Foundation  
**Score: 6/10**  
**Rationale:** Each component has a solid foundation, but their integration in this context is not yet theoretically established.  
**Suggestions:** Draw more clearly on relevant literature to justify the combined approach.

---

### 16. Technological Feasibility  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Rationale:** All technologies are available and established, though not always trivial to implement together, especially stress granule isolation.  
**Suggestions:** Pilot each technique in-house to ensure feasibility before full-scale integration.

---

### 17. Risk Assessment  
**Score: 5/10**  
**Rationale:** Main risks include technical failure, interpretational ambiguity, and resource overreach.  
**Suggestions:** Develop contingency plans for technical challenges and set clear go/no-go decision points.

---

### 18. Sustainability  
**Score: 5/10**  
**Rationale:** High resource requirements may limit long-term sustainability unless streamlined.  
**Suggestions:** Identify the most informative experiments to maximize insight per resource spent.

---

### 19. Societal Relevance  
**Score: 7/10**  
**Rationale:** If successful, could impact diagnosis/treatment of difficult cancers, making it highly relevant.  
**Suggestions:** Engage patient advocacy groups and clinicians to align research with societal needs.

---

### 20. Future Research Potential  
**Score: 9/10**  
**Rationale:** The approach could open several new research avenues in cancer biology, RNA regulation, and therapeutic targeting.  
**Suggestions:** Design the project to generate rich datasets, enabling secondary analyses and hypothesis generation.

**Overall:**  
This idea is highly innovative and interdisciplinary, with strong future research potential and societal relevance if successful. However, it is methodologically complex, has limited direct empirical precedent, and requires clearer hypothesis articulation and streamlining for parsimony, replicability, and sustainability. Addressing these limitations will improve the project’s feasibility and impact.
