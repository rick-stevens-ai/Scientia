# Final Report: Idea 39

## Title

is generalizable beyond glioma to other CNS tumors...

## One Sentence Summary



## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach



### Scientific Evaluation

** There is growing empirical evidence for the gut-brain-immune axis [Colombo 2021; Ma 2022], and this idea is theoretically sound, unifying microbiome and tumor immunology. Explanatory power is high for microbiome-related differences in brain tumor outcomes. Falsifiability is achieved by blocking metabolite transport and observing immune/tumor changes. The approach is generalizable beyond glioma to other CNS tumors, innovative, and methodologically rigorous. Future research could identify microbiome-targeted adjuvants for brain tumor immunotherapy.
