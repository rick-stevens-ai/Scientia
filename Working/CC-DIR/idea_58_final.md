# Final Report: Idea 58

## Title

** Targeting Cancer Resistance via Ribosome Subtype Inhibition

## One Sentence Summary

** Cancer therapy resistance is driven by ribosomal heterogeneity, which can be targeted via subtype-specific inhibitors.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Ribosomal heterogeneity underlies selective translation of resistance-promoting genes in cancer [Mills 2017]. This idea proposes that small molecules targeting specific ribosome subtypes can re-sensitize resistant tumors. The novelty is in the therapeutic targeting of translational machinery heterogeneity.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
Ribosome profiling and proteomics will map ribosome subtype composition in resistant cancers. High-throughput screening will identify inhibitors of candidate ribosome subtypes. Functional validation will be performed in vitro and in xenograft models.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
Supported by ribosomal heterogeneity evidence [Mills 2017], the model is theoretically sound, falsifiable, and innovative. The approach is generalizable and methodologically robust, with future drug development potential.
