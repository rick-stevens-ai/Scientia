## Title

** Epitranscriptomic mRNA Remodeling in Pancreatic Cancer Stress Granules

## One Sentence Summary

** Stress granules in pancreatic cancer serve as hubs for dynamic mRNA modification, promoting dormancy and drug evasion.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Upon exposure to stress, pancreatic cancer cells assemble stress granules (SGs) that sequester and epitranscriptomically modify mRNAs, particularly via m6A methylation [Barbieri 2017; Anders 2018]. This process stabilizes pro-survival and anti-apoptotic transcripts, fostering a dormant phenotype that enables therapy evasion. The novelty lies in integrating SG biology and epitranscriptomic regulation as a therapeutic resistance mechanism.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
SGs will be isolated from stressed pancreatic cancer cells, with their mRNA content and modifications characterized by m6A-seq and LC-MS/MS. Disruption of SG assembly or m6A machinery (CRISPR/Cas9, chemical inhibitors) will test their role in dormancy and drug resistance, both in vitro and in vivo. Live-cell imaging will monitor real-time changes in mRNA localization and modification.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
The hypothesis is grounded in recent evidence for m6A and SGs in cancer [Barbieri 2017; Anders 2018]. The model is parsimonious and theoretically coherent, explaining dormancy with high explanatory and predictive power. Falsifiability is clearâ€”disrupting SG-m6A axes should sensitize cells. The approach is methodologically robust and innovative, with broad generalizability. Future directions include targeting SG-m6A pathways for therapy.
