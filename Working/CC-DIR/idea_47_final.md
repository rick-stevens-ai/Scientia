## Title

** Functional Ribosome Heterogeneity in Melanoma Therapeutic Escape

## One Sentence Summary

** Ribosomal protein composition shifts promote selective translation of resistance-related mRNAs in melanoma, driving therapeutic escape.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Cancer cells may adapt to therapy by altering their ribosome protein composition, creating a pool of "specialized ribosomes" optimized for translating resistance-linked mRNAs [Shi 2017; Mills 2017]. In melanoma, this adaptive translation is hypothesized to underlie the emergence of drug-resistant phenotypes, with specific ribosomal proteins or rRNA modifications facilitating selective mRNA engagement. The novelty is the focus on ribosome function as a modifiable resistance driver.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
Ribosome profiling and CRISPR-mediated perturbation of candidate ribosomal proteins will be undertaken in therapy-resistant and sensitive melanoma cells. Polysome RNA-seq will identify selectively translated mRNAs. Functional resistance assays will test the necessity of candidate ribosomal proteins for survival under therapy. The main challenge is establishing direct causality, addressed via loss- and gain-of-function studies and rescue experiments.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
The idea is empirically supported by findings of ribosomal heterogeneity in cancer [Mills 2017]. Theoretically, it expands resistance models to the translational level with strong explanatory and predictive power. Falsifiability is ensured via CRISPR perturbation. The approach is methodologically robust, generalizable, and innovative, opening the door to translation-targeted therapies. Future research could screen for drugs disrupting specialized ribosomes.
