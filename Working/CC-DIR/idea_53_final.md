## Title

** Therapy-Resistant Melanoma via Specialized Ribosome Assembly

## One Sentence Summary

** Melanoma cells develop therapy resistance by assembling specialized ribosomes that preferentially translate pro-survival mRNAs.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Specialized ribosomes, with altered protein or rRNA components, can selectively translate mRNAs critical for cellular survival [Shi 2017]. This idea proposes that resistant melanoma cells assemble such ribosomes to prioritize translation of resistance-promoting genes, establishing a novel translational axis for therapeutic escape. The novelty lies in targeting ribosome heterogeneity as a modifiable resistance mechanism.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
Ribosome profiling and proteomics will compare ribosome composition in resistant versus sensitive melanoma cells. Candidate specialized ribosomal proteins will be perturbed using CRISPR/Cas9. Polysome fractionation coupled to RNA-seq will assess translational selectivity. Resistance assays in vitro and in vivo will confirm functional necessity.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
Supported by evidence for ribosome specialization in cancer [Shi 2017; Mills 2017], the model is theoretically robust and falsifiableâ€”perturbing specialized ribosomes should impair resistance. The approach is methodologically rigorous and innovative, paving the way for translation-targeted therapies. Future research may identify modulators of ribosome assembly.
