## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach

** The experimental strategy includes untargeted metabolomics to identify microbiome-derived compounds in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tumor tissue of mouse models with altered gut flora. Germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice, as well as fecal microbiota transplant recipients, will be compared for brain tumor growth and immune infiltration (flow cytometry, scRNA-seq). Radiolabeled metabolites can track BBB permeability. Manipulation of metabolite levels (e.g., butyrate supplementation) will test direct effects. Key challenges are validating in vivo metabolite transfer and isolating immune-specific effects.
