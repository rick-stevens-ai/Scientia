## One Sentence Summary



## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach



### Scientific Evaluation

** The idea is empirically supported by findings of ribosomal heterogeneity in cancer [Mills 2017]. Theoretically, it adds a new regulatory layer to resistance, with strong explanatory and predictive power for therapy outcomes. Falsifiability is ensured via loss/gain-of-function assays. The approach is moderately parsimonious, generalizable to other cancers with therapy resistance, and methodologically robust. Innovation is high due to the focus on ribosome specialization as a resistance driver. Future studies could screen for small molecules targeting these specialized ribosome subsets.
