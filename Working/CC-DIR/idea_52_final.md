## Title

** Stress Granule-Mediated Epitranscriptomic Dormancy in Cancer Cells

## One Sentence Summary

** Stress granules mediate dynamic mRNA modifications that induce dormancy and therapy evasion in cancer.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

**  
Pancreatic cancer cells exposed to stress form SGs, which selectively sequester and modify mRNAs (e.g., m6A methylation), stabilizing transcripts that promote dormancy and resistance [Anders 2018; Barbieri 2017]. This spatialâ€“epitranscriptomic integration forms a mechanistic basis for reversible therapy evasion. The novelty lies in identifying SG-associated mRNA modification as a therapeutic resistance driver.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

**  
SGs will be purified from stressed cells; mRNA modifications will be profiled via m6A-seq and LC-MS/MS. Disrupting SG assembly or m6A writers/readers will be performed by CRISPR or chemical inhibition. Dormancy and therapy response assays will confirm functional relevance. Single-molecule RNA FISH and live-cell imaging will verify the spatial association of m6A-modified mRNAs with SGs.

### Scientific Evaluation

**  
The hypothesis is strongly supported by recent studies [Anders 2018; Barbieri 2017]. Theoretical coherence and predictive power are high; falsifiability is clear. The approach is methodologically sound and innovative, integrating spatial and chemical RNA biology. Future avenues include screening for drugs that disrupt SG-mRNA modification interactions.
