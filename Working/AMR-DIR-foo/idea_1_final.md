## One Sentence Summary

Antimicrobial peptides can target Mtb's cell membrane, disrupting its integrity.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have shown promise in targeting various pathogens, including Mtb. By disrupting the bacterial membrane, AMPs can effectively kill Mtb cells. This approach is novel as it targets a critical component of the bacterial cell wall, which is essential for its survival [1].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of AMPs against Mtb. We will use techniques such as fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry to assess membrane disruption.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as AMPs have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of membrane disruption as a mechanism of action. Explanatory power is high, as it can be applied to various bacterial species.
