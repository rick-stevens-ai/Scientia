## One Sentence Summary

Inhibiting Mtb's type VII secretion system can prevent its survival.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

The type VII secretion system is essential for Mtb's survival and pathogenesis. Inhibiting this system can prevent Mtb from secreting critical virulence factors. This approach is novel as it targets a specific secretion system essential for Mtb's survival [5].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques to evaluate the efficacy of type VII secretion system inhibitors against Mtb. We will use techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and biochemical assays to assess secretion system disruption.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as type VII secretion system inhibitors have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of secretion system targeting as a mechanism of action.
