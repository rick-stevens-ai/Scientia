## One Sentence Summary

Carbohydrate-based therapies can target Mtb's cell wall, inhibiting its growth.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

The mycobacterial cell wall is a critical component of its survival. Carbohydrate-based therapies can target specific components of the cell wall, such as arabinogalactan, to inhibit Mtb growth. This approach is novel as it targets a specific component of the bacterial cell wall [3].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques to evaluate the efficacy of carbohydrate-based therapies against Mtb. We will use techniques such as NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to assess cell wall disruption.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as carbohydrate-based therapies have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of cell wall targeting as a mechanism of action.
