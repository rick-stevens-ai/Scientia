## Title

Targeting Mtb's Extracellular Vesicles

## One Sentence Summary

Mtb's extracellular vesicles can be targeted to prevent its survival.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Mtb's extracellular vesicles play a crucial role in its survival and pathogenesis. Targeting these vesicles can prevent Mtb from establishing persistent infections [65].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use biochemical and biophysical techniques to evaluate the efficacy of extracellular vesicle inhibitors against Mtb. Techniques such as Western blotting and electron microscopy will assess vesicle disruption.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as extracellular vesicle targeting has been effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in understanding vesicle targeting.
