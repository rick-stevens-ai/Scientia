# Final Report: Idea 4

## Title

Nanoparticles can be used to deliver antimicrobials directly...

## One Sentence Summary

Nanoparticles can be used to deliver antimicrobials directly to Mtb-infected cells.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Nanoparticles have shown promise in delivering antimicrobials directly to infected cells, reducing systemic toxicity and improving efficacy. This approach is novel as it targets Mtb-infected cells specifically [7].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of nanoparticle-mediated antimicrobial delivery against Mtb. We will use techniques such as TEM and fluorescence microscopy to assess nanoparticle uptake and delivery.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as nanoparticles have been shown to be effective in delivering antimicrobials against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of nanoparticle-mediated delivery as a mechanism of action.
