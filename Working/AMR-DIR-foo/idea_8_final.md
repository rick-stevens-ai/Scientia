## One Sentence Summary

Host-directed therapies can target Mtb's host-pathogen interactions, inhibiting its survival.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Host-directed therapies have shown promise in targeting host-pathogen interactions, reducing bacterial loads and inflammation. This approach is novel as it targets host-pathogen interactions specifically [15].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of host-directed therapies against Mtb. We will use techniques such as RNA sequencing and flow cytometry to assess host-pathogen interactions.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as host-directed therapies have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of host-pathogen interactions as a mechanism of action.
