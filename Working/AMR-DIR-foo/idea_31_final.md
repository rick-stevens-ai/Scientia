# Final Report: Idea 31

## Title

Bacteriophage Therapy for Mtb

## One Sentence Summary

Bacteriophages can target and kill Mtb cells.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Bacteriophages have shown promise in targeting and killing bacterial pathogens, including Mtb, by specifically infecting and lysing bacterial cells. This approach leverages the specificity and efficacy of bacteriophages in combating bacterial infections [13].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of bacteriophage therapy against Mtb. Techniques such as plaque assays and electron microscopy will be employed to assess bacteriophage efficacy.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as bacteriophages have been effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the mechanism of bacteriophage-mediated killing.
