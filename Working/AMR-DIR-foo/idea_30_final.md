## One Sentence Summary

Inhibiting Mtb's peptidoglycan synthesis can prevent its growth.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Mtb's peptidoglycan synthesis is essential for its survival and pathogenesis. Inhibiting this process can prevent Mtb from building its cell wall, effectively killing it. This approach is novel as it targets a critical component of Mtb's cell wall synthesis machinery [59].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques to evaluate the efficacy of peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors against Mtb. We will use techniques such as fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry to assess cell wall disruption.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of cell wall targeting as a mechanism of action.
