## One Sentence Summary

Inhibiting Mtb's lipid raft formation can prevent its survival.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Mtb's lipid rafts are essential for its survival and pathogenesis. Inhibiting lipid raft formation can prevent Mtb from establishing persistent infections. This approach is novel as it targets specific lipid metabolic pathways [47].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques to evaluate the efficacy of lipid raft inhibitors against Mtb. We will use techniques such as fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry to assess lipid raft disruption.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as lipid raft inhibitors have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of lipid raft targeting as a mechanism of action.
