# Final Report: Idea 7

## Title

Bacteriophages can be used to target and kill Mtb cells

## One Sentence Summary

Bacteriophages can be used to target and kill Mtb cells.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Bacteriophages have shown promise in targeting and killing bacterial pathogens, including Mtb. By using bacteriophages, we can effectively target Mtb cells without harming host cells. This approach is novel as it targets Mtb specifically [13].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of bacteriophage therapy against Mtb. We will use techniques such as plaque assays and electron microscopy to assess bacteriophage efficacy.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as bacteriophages have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of bacteriophage-mediated killing as a mechanism of action.
