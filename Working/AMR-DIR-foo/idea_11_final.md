## Title

Targeting Mtb's lipid metabolism can inhibit its growth

## One Sentence Summary

Targeting Mtb's lipid metabolism can inhibit its growth.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Mtb's lipid metabolism is essential for its survival. Targeting specific lipid metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid synthesis, can inhibit Mtb growth. This approach is novel as it targets specific lipid metabolic pathways [21].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques to evaluate the efficacy of lipid metabolism inhibitors against Mtb. We will use techniques such as metabolomics and flux analysis to assess lipid metabolic disruption.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as lipid metabolism inhibitors have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of lipid metabolism targeting as a mechanism of action.
