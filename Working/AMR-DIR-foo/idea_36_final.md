## Title

Photoacoustic Therapy against Mtb

## One Sentence Summary

Photoacoustic therapy can target Mtb-infected cells.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Photoacoustic therapy uses light and sound waves to generate heat and mechanical stress, effectively killing bacterial cells. This approach targets Mtb-infected cells specifically [69].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of photoacoustic therapy against Mtb. Techniques such as fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry will assess cellular disruption.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as photoacoustic therapy has been effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in photoacoustic energy conversion.
