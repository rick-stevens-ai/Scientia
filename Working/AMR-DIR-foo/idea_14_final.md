## One Sentence Summary

B cell epitope-based vaccines can target Mtb's surface antigens, inducing protective immunity.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

B cell epitope-based vaccines have shown promise in inducing protective immunity against various bacterial pathogens, including Mtb. By targeting specific surface antigens, B cell epitope-based vaccines can effectively induce immunity. This approach is novel as it targets specific surface antigens [27].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of B cell epitope-based vaccines against Mtb. We will use techniques such as ELISA and flow cytometry to assess immune responses.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as B cell epitope-based vaccines have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of immune epitope targeting as a mechanism of action.
