## One Sentence Summary

Inhibiting Mtb's two-component systems can prevent its survival.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Mtb's two-component systems are essential for its survival and pathogenesis. Inhibiting these systems can prevent Mtb from responding to environmental cues. This approach is novel as it targets specific two-component systems [43].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques to evaluate the efficacy of two-component system inhibitors against Mtb. We will use techniques such as phosphoprotein analysis and molecular dynamics simulations to assess two-component system disruption.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as two-component system inhibitors have been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of two-component system targeting as a mechanism of action.
