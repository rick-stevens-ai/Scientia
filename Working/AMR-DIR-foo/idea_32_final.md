## Title

CRISPR-Cas13 Delivery via Nanoparticles for Mtb

## One Sentence Summary

CRISPR-Cas13 can be delivered via nanoparticles to detect and treat Mtb infections.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

CRISPR-Cas13 has shown promise in detecting and treating bacterial infections by targeting specific genes. Delivering CRISPR-Cas13 via nanoparticles enhances its specificity and efficacy against Mtb [61].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of nanoparticle-delivered CRISPR-Cas13 against Mtb. Techniques such as RT-qPCR and sequencing will assess gene editing efficiency.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as CRISPR-Cas13 and nanoparticles have been effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in gene editing and targeted delivery.
