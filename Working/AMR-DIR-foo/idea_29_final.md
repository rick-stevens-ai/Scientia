## One Sentence Summary

Cytokine activation can enhance the host's immune response against Mtb.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Cytokine activation has shown promise in enhancing the host's immune response against various bacterial pathogens, including Mtb. By activating specific cytokines, we can effectively target Mtb cells. This approach is novel as it targets specific cytokines [57].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of cytokine activation against Mtb. We will use techniques such as ELISA and flow cytometry to assess immune responses.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as cytokine activation has been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of immune activation as a mechanism of action.
