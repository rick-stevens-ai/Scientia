# Final Report: Idea 25

## Title

CRISPR-Cas12 can be used to detect Mtb infections

## One Sentence Summary

CRISPR-Cas12 can be used to detect Mtb infections.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

CRISPR-Cas12 has shown promise in detecting bacterial infections, including Mtb. By targeting specific Mtb genes, CRISPR-Cas12 can effectively detect Mtb infections. This approach is novel as it targets specific Mtb genes [49].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas12 against Mtb. We will use techniques such as RT-qPCR and sequencing to assess gene detection efficiency.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as CRISPR-Cas12 has been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of gene detection as a mechanism of action.
