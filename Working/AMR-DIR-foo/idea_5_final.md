# Final Report: Idea 5

## Title

CRISPR-Cas13 can be used to detect and treat Mtb infections

## One Sentence Summary

CRISPR-Cas13 can be used to detect and treat Mtb infections.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

CRISPR-Cas13 has shown promise in detecting and treating bacterial infections, including Mtb. By targeting specific Mtb genes, CRISPR-Cas13 can effectively detect and kill Mtb cells. This approach is novel as it targets specific Mtb genes [9].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas13 against Mtb. We will use techniques such as RT-qPCR and sequencing to assess gene editing efficiency.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as CRISPR-Cas13 has been shown to be effective against various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of gene editing as a mechanism of action.
