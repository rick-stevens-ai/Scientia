## One Sentence Summary

Genomics can be used to identify antimicrobial resistance genes in Mtb.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Genomics has shown promise in identifying antimicrobial resistance genes in various bacterial pathogens, including Mtb. By identifying these genes, we can develop targeted therapies. This approach is novel as it targets specific resistance genes [19].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of genomic and bioinformatic techniques to evaluate the efficacy of genomics-based approaches against Mtb. We will use techniques such as whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to assess resistance gene identification.

### Scientific Evaluation

This approach has empirical support, as genomics has been shown to be effective in identifying resistance genes in various bacterial pathogens. Its theoretical coherence lies in the understanding of genomics-based approaches as a mechanism of action.
