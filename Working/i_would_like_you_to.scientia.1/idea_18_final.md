## One Sentence Summary

, researchers could use small RNA sequencing to identify radiation-induced miRNAs and target prediction algorithms to identify candidates that regulate FDXR. Luciferase reporter assays could validate miRNA–FDXR interactions. Dose-response experiments would quantify miRNA levels and FDXR activity. Challenges include distinguishing direct regulatory effects from broader transcriptional changes.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, researchers could use small RNA sequencing to identify radiation-induced miRNAs and target prediction algorithms to identify candidates that regulate FDXR. Luciferase reporter assays could validate miRNA–FDXR interactions. Dose-response experiments would quantify miRNA levels and FDXR activity. Challenges include distinguishing direct regulatory effects from broader transcriptional changes.
