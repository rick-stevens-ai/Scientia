## One Sentence Summary

, researchers could use chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to examine histone modifications near the FDXR locus following exposure to low radiation doses. Parallel experiments could measure DNA methylation patterns using bisulfite sequencing. RNA-seq could confirm dose-dependent changes in FDXR expression. Key challenges include disentangling direct radiation effects from indirect cellular signaling cascades.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, researchers could use chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to examine histone modifications near the FDXR locus following exposure to low radiation doses. Parallel experiments could measure DNA methylation patterns using bisulfite sequencing. RNA-seq could confirm dose-dependent changes in FDXR expression. Key challenges include disentangling direct radiation effects from indirect cellular signaling cascades.
