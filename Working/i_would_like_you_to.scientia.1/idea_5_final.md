## One Sentence Summary



## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach



### Scientific Evaluation

This idea is theoretically coherent, as epigenetic regulation is known to mediate gene-environment interactions. It offers strong explanatory power for the linear dose-response and is falsifiable through direct measurements of epigenetic changes. Predictive capability could be enhanced by modeling epigenetic dynamics under radiation exposure. The approach is innovative and generalizable, as epigenetic mechanisms likely influence other radiation-sensitive genes. Future research could explore therapeutic modulation of epigenetic states to alter radiation sensitivity.
