## One Sentence Summary

, researchers could use ROS-specific probes (e.g., MitoSOX) combined with ChIP-seq and bisulfite sequencing to identify histone modifications and methylation dynamics at the FDXR locus. CRISPR-mediated editing of histone marks or demethylation enzymes at the locus could confirm causality. Super-resolution microscopy could visualize mitochondrial-specific chromatin interactions. Key challenges include distinguishing mitochondrial ROS effects from general oxidative stress and ensuring radiation-specificity in epigenetic modifications.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach

To validate the hypothesis, researchers could use ROS-specific probes (e.g., MitoSOX) combined with ChIP-seq and bisulfite sequencing to identify histone modifications and methylation dynamics at the FDXR locus. CRISPR-mediated editing of histone marks or demethylation enzymes at the locus could confirm causality. Super-resolution microscopy could visualize mitochondrial-specific chromatin interactions. Key challenges include distinguishing mitochondrial ROS effects from general oxidative stress and ensuring radiation-specificity in epigenetic modifications.
