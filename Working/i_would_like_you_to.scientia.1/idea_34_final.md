## One Sentence Summary

further narrows its scope to mitochondrial-specific effects on chromatin states, avoiding confounding oxidative stress responses. The novelty lies in linking mitochondrial ROS with targeted epigenetic modifications, explaining radiation sensitivity through localized chromatin remodeling.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

This refinement integrates feedback by focusing on specific epigenetic mechanisms influenced by mitochondrial ROS rather than general chromatin accessibility. It proposes that mitochondrial ROS generated during radiation exposure mediate dose-dependent histone modifications (e.g., H3K4me3) and DNA methylation at the FDXR locus. The hypothesis further narrows its scope to mitochondrial-specific effects on chromatin states, avoiding confounding oxidative stress responses. The novelty lies in linking mitochondrial ROS with targeted epigenetic modifications, explaining radiation sensitivity through localized chromatin remodeling.
