## Title

posits that mitochondrial ROS amplify cellular stress signal...

## One Sentence Summary

posits that mitochondrial ROS amplify cellular stress signaling, leading to a dose-proportional activation of FDXR. The novelty lies in linking FDXR's linear dose response to mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative stress amplification pathways. This framework could explain why FDXR responds consistently across a wide dose range.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

FDXR, known for its role in mitochondrial function, may exhibit radiation sensitivity due to mitochondrial stress amplification mechanisms. Radiation could generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate FDXR as part of a feedback loop. This hypothesis posits that mitochondrial ROS amplify cellular stress signaling, leading to a dose-proportional activation of FDXR. The novelty lies in linking FDXR's linear dose response to mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative stress amplification pathways. This framework could explain why FDXR responds consistently across a wide dose range.
