# Research Summary: i_would_like_you_to

## Research Goal

I would like you to propose many ideas that explain the radiation senstitivity of FDXR to
low-dose and explain its nearly linear dose response over many orders of magnitdue dose
from 0.01 Gy to 1.0 Gy.

   is parsimonious, attributing linearity to a single amplification mechanism. Predictive capability could be tested by modifying ROS levels pharmacologically and monitoring FDXR responses. Methodologica...

3. **[Mitochondrial ROS Feedback in Radiation-Induced Gene Activation](idea_26_final.md)** - ELO: 1214.3

   Radiation-induced mitochondrial ROS amplify cellular stress signaling, leading to dose-proportional activation of FDXR through chromatin accessibility modulation.

4. **[Radiation-induced mitochondrial ROS uniquely drive histone m...](idea_33_final.md)** - ELO: 1214.2

   Radiation-induced mitochondrial ROS uniquely drive histone modifications and DNA methylation at the FDXR locus, regulating its dose-dependent expression.

5. **[FDXR's radiation sensitivity is mediated by dose-dependent e...](idea_2_final.md)** - ELO: 1213.4

   FDXR's radiation sensitivity is mediated by dose-dependent epigenetic modifications.
