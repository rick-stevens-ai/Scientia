**Key Idea**: FDXR interacts with DNA repair pathways to influence radiation sensitivity and dose response.

**Paragraph 1**: DNA repair pathways play a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and influencing radiation response [Li 2017]. FDXR can interact with DNA repair pathways to influence its radiation sensitivity and dose response. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that DNA repair pathways can influence gene expression and radiation response [Zhang 2018].

**Paragraph 2**: To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of DNA repair assays and gene expression analysis to investigate interactions between FDXR and DNA repair pathways. We will use techniques such as comet assays and qRT-PCR to analyze DNA damage and FDXR expression, respectively. Potential challenges include controlling for confounding variables and ensuring the accuracy of DNA repair data.

**Key Idea**: FDXR interacts with DNA repair pathways to influence radiation sensitivity and dose response.

**Paragraph 1**: DNA repair pathways play a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and influencing radiation response [Li 2017]. FDXR can interact with DNA repair pathways to influence its radiation sensitivity and dose response. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that DNA repair pathways can influence gene expression and radiation response [Zhang 2018].

**Paragraph 2**: To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of DNA repair assays and gene expression analysis to investigate interactions between FDXR and DNA repair pathways. We will use techniques such as comet assays and qRT-PCR to analyze DNA damage and FDXR expression, respectively. Potential challenges include controlling for confounding variables and ensuring the accuracy of DNA repair data.

**Paragraph 3**: This idea performs well across scientific evaluation criteria, including empirical support from studies on DNA repair pathways and radiation response [Li 2017], theoretical coherence with existing knowledge on DNA repair and gene regulation [Zhang 2018], and explanatory power for the observed dose response of FDXR. The idea also has predictive capability, as changes in DNA repair pathways can be used to forecast radiation sensitivity.
