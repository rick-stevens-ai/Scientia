## One Sentence Summary

The radiation response of FDXR in 3D cell cultures differs from that in 2D cell cultures, influencing its radiation sensitivity and dose response.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

The radiation response of cells in 3D cultures can differ significantly from that in 2D cultures [Wang 2019]. FDXR radiation response and sensitivity can be influenced by the 3D cellular environment, leading to changes in its dose response. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that 3D cell cultures can influence gene expression and radiation response [Li 2020].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of 3D cell culture and radiation sensitivity assays to investigate FDXR radiation response and sensitivity in 3D cultures. We will use techniques such as 3D cell culture and clonogenic assays to analyze radiation response and sensitivity, respectively. Potential challenges include controlling for confounding variables and ensuring the accuracy of 3D cell culture data.

### Scientific Evaluation

This idea performs well across scientific evaluation criteria, including empirical support from studies on 3D cell cultures and radiation response [Wang 2019], theoretical coherence with existing knowledge on 3D cell cultures and gene regulation [Li 2020], and explanatory power for the observed dose response of FDXR. The idea also has predictive capability, as changes in 3D cell culture can be used to forecast radiation sensitivity.
