## One Sentence Summary

, we will use nanodosimetric simulations and experimental data from low-dose radiation exposures to investigate the physical interactions between radiation and FDXR. We will also use Monte Carlo simulations to model radiation-induced damage to DNA and chromatin. Potential challenges include validating model predictions with experimental data and accounting for inter-individual variability.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use nanodosimetric simulations and experimental data from low-dose radiation exposures to investigate the physical interactions between radiation and FDXR. We will also use Monte Carlo simulations to model radiation-induced damage to DNA and chromatin. Potential challenges include validating model predictions with experimental data and accounting for inter-individual variability.
