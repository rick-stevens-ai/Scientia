## Evaluation of Ideas and Alignment with Research Goal

The proposed ideas aim to explain the radiation sensitivity of FDXR to low-dose radiation and its nearly linear dose response over many orders of magnitude. Overall, the ideas are aligned with the research goal and explore various mechanisms that could contribute to the observed radiation sensitivity of FDXR.

## Epigenetic Modulation of FDXR Radiation Sensitivity

The first set of ideas explores the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating FDXR expression in response to low-dose radiation. This is a valid approach, as epigenetic changes have been shown to play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to radiation [1]. The use of epigenetic editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, and molecular biology techniques, including qRT-PCR and Western blotting, is well-justified.

## Stochastic Modeling of Radiation-Induced FDXR Activation

The second set of ideas proposes a stochastic modeling approach to explain the radiation sensitivity of FDXR. This approach is also valid, as stochastic modeling has been used to describe the behavior of complex biological systems, including radiation response [4]. The use of Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data from low-dose radiation exposures is a suitable method to investigate the physical interactions between radiation and FDXR.

## Mitochondrial ROS-Mediated FDXR Radiation Sensitivity

The third set of ideas explores the role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mediating FDXR radiation sensitivity. This is a plausible mechanism, as mitochondrial ROS have been implicated in radiation response and cellular signaling [6]. The use of biochemical assays and mitochondrial-specific fluorescent probes is a suitable approach to investigate ROS production and FDXR expression.

## Systems Biology Analysis of FDXR Radiation Response

The fourth set of ideas proposes a systems biology approach to understand the complex interactions between FDXR and other genes and proteins involved in radiation response. This approach is valid, as systems biology approaches can provide insights into complex biological systems, including radiation response [8]. The use of bioinformatics tools and systems biology approaches, including network analysis and pathway modeling, is well-justified.

## Nanodosimetric Modeling of Radiation-Induced FDXR Damage

The fifth set of ideas explores the role of nanodosimetric modeling in explaining the radiation sensitivity of FDXR. This approach is also valid, as nanodosimetric modeling has been used to describe the physical interactions between radiation and biological systems [10]. The use of nanodosimetric simulations and experimental data from low-dose radiation exposures is a suitable method to investigate the physical interactions between radiation and FDXR.

## Ethical, Feasibility, and Scope Concerns

Overall, the ideas are within the scope of the research goal and do not raise significant ethical or feasibility concerns.
