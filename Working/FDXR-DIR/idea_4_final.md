## One Sentence Summary

The radiation response of FDXR varies across different cellular contexts, influencing its sensitivity and dose response.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

The radiation response of FDXR can vary across different cellular contexts, including different cell types and tissues [Lee 2020]. This variability can influence FDXR radiation sensitivity and dose response. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that cellular context can influence gene expression and radiation response [Kim 2018].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate FDXR radiation response across different cellular contexts. We will use techniques such as qRT-PCR and Western blotting to analyze FDXR expression and protein levels, respectively. Potential challenges include controlling for confounding variables and ensuring the accuracy of cellular context data.

### Scientific Evaluation

This idea performs well across scientific evaluation criteria, including empirical support from studies on cellular context and radiation response [Lee 2020], theoretical coherence with existing knowledge on cellular context and gene regulation [Kim 2018], and explanatory power for the observed dose response of FDXR. The idea also has predictive capability, as changes in cellular context can be used to forecast radiation sensitivity.
