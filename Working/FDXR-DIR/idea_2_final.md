## Title

MicroRNAs play a crucial role in regulating FDXR expression...

## One Sentence Summary

MicroRNAs play a crucial role in regulating FDXR expression and radiation sensitivity in response to low-dose radiation.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

MicroRNAs have been shown to play a key role in regulating gene expression in response to radiation [Liu 2017]. Specifically, certain microRNAs can target FDXR and influence its expression and radiation sensitivity. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that microRNAs can regulate gene expression and influence radiation response [Li 2018].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use microRNA sequencing and target validation assays to investigate the role of microRNAs in regulating FDXR expression and radiation sensitivity. We will use techniques such as miRNA-seq and luciferase assays to analyze microRNA expression and target validation, respectively. Potential challenges include ensuring the accuracy of microRNA sequencing data and controlling for off-target effects.

### Scientific Evaluation

This idea performs well across scientific evaluation criteria, including empirical support from studies on microRNA regulation and radiation response [Liu 2017], theoretical coherence with existing knowledge on microRNA function [Li 2018], and explanatory power for the observed dose response of FDXR. The idea also has predictive capability, as changes in microRNA expression can be used to forecast radiation sensitivity.
