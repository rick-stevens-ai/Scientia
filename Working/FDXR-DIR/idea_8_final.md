## One Sentence Summary

The radiation sensitivity of FDXR varies across different genomic backgrounds, influencing its dose response.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

The genomic background of cells can influence radiation response and FDXR radiation sensitivity [Kim 2019]. Different genomic backgrounds can affect FDXR expression and function, leading to changes in radiation sensitivity. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that genomic background can influence gene expression and radiation response [Li 2018].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of genomic analysis and radiation sensitivity assays to investigate FDXR radiation sensitivity across different genomic backgrounds. We will use techniques such as whole-exome sequencing and clonogenic assays to analyze genomic changes and radiation sensitivity, respectively. Potential challenges include controlling for confounding variables and ensuring the accuracy of genomic data.

### Scientific Evaluation

This idea performs well across scientific evaluation criteria, including empirical support from studies on genomic background and radiation response [Kim 2019], theoretical coherence with existing knowledge on genomic background and gene regulation [Li 2018], and explanatory power for the observed dose response of FDXR. The idea also has predictive capability, as changes in genomic background can be used to forecast radiation sensitivity.
