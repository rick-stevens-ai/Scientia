## One Sentence Summary

, we will use a combination of biochemical assays and mitochondrial-specific fluorescent probes to investigate ROS production and FDXR expression in response to low-dose radiation. We will also use pharmacological inhibitors of mitochondrial ROS production to examine the role of ROS in FDXR radiation sensitivity. Potential challenges include controlling for ROS production from other sources and validating the role of ROS in FDXR regulation.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description



### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of biochemical assays and mitochondrial-specific fluorescent probes to investigate ROS production and FDXR expression in response to low-dose radiation. We will also use pharmacological inhibitors of mitochondrial ROS production to examine the role of ROS in FDXR radiation sensitivity. Potential challenges include controlling for ROS production from other sources and validating the role of ROS in FDXR regulation.
