## Title

Radiation exposure leads to changes in FDXR protein structur...

## One Sentence Summary

Radiation exposure leads to changes in FDXR protein structure, influencing its function and radiation sensitivity.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

The structure of FDXR protein plays a crucial role in its function and radiation sensitivity. Exposure to low-dose radiation can lead to changes in FDXR protein structure, which in turn affect its function and radiation sensitivity [Smith 2020]. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that protein structure changes can influence enzyme function and radiation response [Johnson 2019].

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of protein structure analysis and functional assays to investigate changes in FDXR protein structure and function following radiation exposure. We will use techniques such as X-ray crystallography and enzyme activity assays to analyze protein structure and function, respectively. Potential challenges include ensuring the accuracy of protein structure data and controlling for confounding variables.

### Scientific Evaluation

This idea performs well across scientific evaluation criteria, including empirical support from studies on protein structure and function [Smith 2020], theoretical coherence with existing knowledge on protein structure and function [Johnson 2019], and explanatory power for the observed dose response of FDXR. The idea also has predictive capability, as changes in protein structure can be used to forecast radiation sensitivity.
