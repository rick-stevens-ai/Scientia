The proposed ideas aim to explain the radiation sensitivity of FDXR to low-dose radiation and its nearly linear dose response over many orders of magnitude. Overall, the ideas are aligned with the research goal and explore various mechanisms that could contribute to the observed radiation sensitivity of FDXR.

## Epigenetic Modulation of FDXR Radiation Sensitivity

The first set of ideas explores the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating FDXR expression in response to low-dose radiation. This is a valid approach, as epigenetic changes have been shown to play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to radiation [1]. The use of epigenetic editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, and molecular biology techniques, including qRT-PCR and Western blotting, is well-justified.

## Stochastic Modeling of Radiation-Induced FDXR Activation
