## One Sentence Summary



## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

Mitochondrial ROS have been implicated in radiation response and cellular signaling [6]. We propose that mitochondrial ROS production is a key mediator of FDXR radiation sensitivity, particularly at low doses. ROS may induce changes in FDXR expression and activity, leading to a nearly linear dose response.
