## Title

Radiation exposure leads to changes in FDXR epigenetic marks...

## One Sentence Summary

Radiation exposure leads to changes in FDXR epigenetic marks, influencing its expression and radiation sensitivity.

## Detailed Description

### Technical Description

The epigenetic landscape of FDXR plays a crucial role in its radiation sensitivity. Exposure to low-dose radiation can lead to changes in epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, which in turn affect FDXR expression [Li 2019]. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that epigenetic modifications can influence gene expression and radiation response [Bird 2002]. The nearly linear dose response of FDXR can be attributed to the gradual changes in epigenetic marks with increasing radiation dose.

### Computational/Experimental Approach

To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of epigenetic sequencing and gene expression analysis to investigate changes in FDXR epigenetic marks and expression following radiation exposure. We will use techniques such as ChIP-seq and RT-qPCR to analyze epigenetic marks and FDXR expression, respectively. Potential challenges include controlling for confounding variables and ensuring the accuracy of epigenetic sequencing data.

### Scientific Evaluation

This idea performs well across scientific evaluation criteria, including empirical support from studies on epigenetic modifications and radiation response [Li 2019], theoretical coherence with existing knowledge on epigenetics and gene regulation [Bird 2002], and explanatory power for the observed dose response of FDXR. The idea also has predictive capability, as changes in epigenetic marks can be used to forecast radiation sensitivity.
