**Key Idea**: The radiation response of FDXR varies across different cellular contexts, influencing its sensitivity and dose response.

**Paragraph 1**: The radiation response of FDXR can vary across different cellular contexts, including different cell types and tissues [Lee 2020]. This variability can influence FDXR radiation sensitivity and dose response. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that cellular context can influence gene expression and radiation response [Kim 2018].

**Paragraph 2**: To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate FDXR radiation response across different cellular contexts. We will use techniques such as qRT-PCR and Western blotting to analyze FDXR expression and protein levels, respectively. Potential challenges include controlling for confounding variables and ensuring the accuracy of cellular context data.

**Paragraph 3**: This idea performs well across scientific evaluation criteria, including empirical support from studies on cellular context and radiation response [Lee 2020], theoretical coherence with existing knowledge on cellular context and gene regulation [Kim 2018], and explanatory power for the observed dose response of FDXR. The idea also has predictive capability, as changes in cellular context can be used to forecast radiation sensitivity.

This variability can influence FDXR radiation sensitivity and dose response. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that cellular context can influence gene expression and radiation response [Kim 2018].

**Paragraph 2**: To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate FDXR radiation response across different cellular contexts. We will use techniques such as qRT-PCR and Western blotting to analyze FDXR expression and protein levels, respectively. Potential challenges include controlling for confounding variables and ensuring the accuracy of cellular context data.
