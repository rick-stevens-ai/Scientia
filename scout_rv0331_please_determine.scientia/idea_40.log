**Title**: Rv0331's Involvement in M. tuberculosis Extracellular Vesicle Formation and Intercellular Communication

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 plays a role in M. tuberculosis extracellular vesicle formation, affecting intercellular communication and immune modulation.

**Paragraph**: Extracellular vesicles are crucial for M. tuberculosis intercellular communication and immune modulation [34]. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of extracellular vesicles in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis [35]. Investigating Rv0331's role in extracellular vesicle formation could reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention.

**Approach**: Use ultracentrifugation, Western blotting, and electron microscopy to assess Rv0331's impact on M. tuberculosis extracellular vesicle formation and its role in intercellular communication.
