**Title**: Investigating Rv0331's Involvement in M. tuberculosis Cell Wall Biosynthesis and Integrity

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 is involved in the biosynthesis and maintenance of M. tuberculosis cell wall components, affecting its structural integrity and potentially serving as a target for novel therapeutics.

**Paragraph**: The M. tuberculosis cell wall is crucial for its survival and pathogenicity [3]. Rv0331's predicted functional domain suggests a possible link to cell wall biosynthesis [4]. Investigating this connection could provide insights into M. tuberculosis's unique cell wall structure and potential vulnerabilities. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cell wall integrity in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis [10]. To refine this idea, we will simplify the

**Approach**: by focusing on key cell wall biosynthesis pathways.

**Approach**: Perform metabolic labeling, biochemical assays, and cell wall integrity tests to assess Rv0331's role in cell wall biosynthesis and maintenance, focusing on key pathways.

**Key References**: [3] Brennan et al. (2002), [4] Dona et al. (2013), [10] Zampieri et al. (2017), [21] Liu et al. (2020)

**Modifications**: 
- Simplified the approach by focusing on key cell wall biosynthesis pathways.
- Added new citation [21] Liu et al. (2020) to support the importance of cell wall biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis.
