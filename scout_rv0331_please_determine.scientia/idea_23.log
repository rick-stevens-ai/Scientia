**Title**: The Role of Rv0331 in M. tuberculosis Virulence and Immune Evasion

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 contributes to M. tuberculosis virulence by modulating the host immune response and evading clearance.

**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis virulence factors are essential for its pathogenicity [5]. Previous studies have shown that Rv0331 is upregulated during infection [6]. Investigating Rv0331's role in virulence could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of immune evasion mechanisms in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis [11].

**Approach**: Use mouse infection models, immunological assays, and cytokine profiling to assess Rv0331's impact on M. tuberculosis virulence and immune evasion.
