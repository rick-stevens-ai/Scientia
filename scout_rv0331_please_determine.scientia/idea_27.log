**Title**: Rv0331's Interactome in M. tuberculosis: A Network Analysis Approach

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 interacts with other M. tuberculosis proteins to modulate its regulatory function and impact pathogenesis.

**Paragraph**: Protein-protein interactions play crucial roles in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis [18]. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of interactome analysis in understanding protein function [19]. Investigating Rv0331's interactome could reveal new insights into its regulatory function.
