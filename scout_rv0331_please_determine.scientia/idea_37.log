**Title**: Elucidating Rv0331's Role in M. tuberculosis Virulence and Immune Evasion

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 contributes to M. tuberculosis virulence by modulating the host immune response and evading clearance, with a focus on its interaction with host immune cells.

**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis virulence factors are essential for its pathogenicity [5]. Previous studies have shown that Rv0331 is upregulated during infection [6]. Investigating Rv0331's role in virulence could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.

**Approach**: Use mouse infection models, immunological assays, cytokine profiling, and co-culture experiments to assess Rv0331's impact on M. tuberculosis virulence and immune evasion, including its interaction with macrophages and dendritic cells.

**Key References**: [5] Flynn et al. (2001), [6] Gey van Pittius et al. (2006), [11] Quijano et al. (2019), [22] Wang et al. (2018), [31] Chen et al. (2022)

**Modifications**: 
- Extended the approach to include assessing Rv0331's interaction with host immune cells.
- Added new citation [31] Chen et al. (2022) to support the role of Rv0331 in immune evasion.
