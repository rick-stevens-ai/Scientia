**Title**: Rv0331's Role in M. tuberculosis-Host Cell Interaction and Immune Modulation

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 interacts with host cells to modulate the immune response and facilitate M. tuberculosis survival and persistence.

**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis interacts with host cells to evade the immune system [7]. Rv0331's predicted surface-exposed location suggests a potential role in host-pathogen interactions [8]. Investigating this interaction could reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of host-pathogen interactions in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis [12].

**Approach**: Use co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry to assess Rv0331's interaction with host cells and its impact on immune modulation.
