**Title**: Rv0331's Involvement in M. tuberculosis Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 plays a role in M. tuberculosis epigenetic regulation, affecting gene expression and its survival and persistence in the host.

**Paragraph**: Epigenetic regulation is crucial for M. tuberculosis survival and pathogenicity [25]. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of epigenetic regulators in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis [26]. Investigating Rv0331's role in epigenetic regulation could reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention.

**Approach**: Use ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and biochemical assays to assess Rv0331's impact on M. tuberculosis epigenetic regulation and gene expression.

**Key References**: [25] Li et al. (2018), [26] Wang et al. (2020)
