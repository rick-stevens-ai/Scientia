**Title**: Rv0331's Role in M. tuberculosis-Host Cell Interaction and Immune Modulation

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 interacts with host cells to modulate the immune response and facilitate M. tuberculosis survival and persistence, with a focus on its surface-exposed location.

**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis interacts with host cells to evade the immune system [7]. Rv0331's predicted surface-exposed location suggests a potential role in host-pathogen interactions [8]. Investigating this interaction could reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention.

**Approach**: Use co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and biochemical assays to assess Rv0331's interaction with host cells and its impact on immune modulation, including its role in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting survival.

**Key References**: [7] Ernst et al. (2007), [8] Daleke et al. (2010), [12] Blasco et al. (2019), [23] Zhang et al. (2020), [32] Li et al. (2022)

**Modifications**: 
- Addressed identified weaknesses by using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches.
- Added new citation [32] Li et al. (2022) to support the role of Rv0331 in host-pathogen interactions.
