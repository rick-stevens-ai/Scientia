**Title**: Rv0331's Role in M. tuberculosis Stress Response and Survival

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 plays a role in M. tuberculosis stress response, affecting its survival and persistence in the host.

**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis stress response mechanisms are essential for its survival and pathogenicity [13]. Rv0331's predicted regulatory function suggests a potential role in stress response [14]. Investigating this connection could provide insights into M. tuberculosis's ability to survive in the host. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of stress response regulators in M. tuberculosis survival [15].

**Approach**: Use stress response assays, qRT-PCR, and RNA-seq to assess Rv0331's impact on M. tuberculosis stress response and survival.
