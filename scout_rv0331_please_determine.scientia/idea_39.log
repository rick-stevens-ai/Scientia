**Title**: Investigating Rv0331's Role in M. tuberculosis Stress Response and Survival

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 plays a role in M. tuberculosis stress response, affecting its survival and persistence in the host, with a focus on its regulatory function.

**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis stress response mechanisms are essential for its survival and pathogenicity [13]. Rv0331's predicted regulatory function suggests a potential role in stress response [14]. Investigating this connection could provide insights into M. tuberculosis's ability to survive in the host.

**Approach**: Use stress response assays, qRT-PCR, RNA-seq, and protein-protein interaction assays to assess Rv0331's impact on M. tuberculosis stress response and survival, including its role in regulating stress response genes.

**Key References**: [13] Rohde et al. (2017), [14] Tob√≥n et al. (2017), [15] Li et al. (2020), [24] Chen et al. (2019), [33] Wang et al. (2022)

**Modifications**: 
- Extended the approach to include assessing Rv0331's regulatory function in stress response.
- Added new citation [33] Wang et al. (2022) to support the role of Rv0331 in stress response.
