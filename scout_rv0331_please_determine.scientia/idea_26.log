**Title**: Rv0331's Involvement in M. tuberculosis Transmission and Aerosolization

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 plays a role in M. tuberculosis transmission by affecting its aerosolization and survival outside the host.

**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis transmission is a complex process involving multiple factors [16]. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of aerosolization in M. tuberculosis transmission [17]. Investigating Rv0331's role in transmission could reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention.

**Approach**: Use aerosolization assays, mouse infection models, and epidemiological studies to assess Rv0331's impact on M. tuberculosis transmission.

**Key References**: [16] Behr et al. (2005), [17] Law et al. (2018)
