## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Refining Rv0331's Regulatory Role in M. tuberculosis Stress Response and Virulence

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 functions as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in M. tuberculosis virulence and stress response, with a focus on its regulatory network under different stress conditions.

**Paragraph**: Rv0331 is a hypothetical protein with a predicted helix-turn-helix motif, suggesting a potential role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation [1]. Previous studies have shown that transcriptional regulators play crucial roles in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis [2]. Investigating Rv0331's regulatory function could reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of stress response regulators in M. tuberculosis survival [9].

**Approach**: Use ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, and protein-protein interaction assays to identify potential target genes and assess Rv0331's impact on the M. tuberculosis transcriptome under different stress conditions, such as nutrient starvation, oxidative stress, and heat shock.

**Modifications**: 
- Extended the approach to include assessing Rv0331's regulatory network under different stress conditions.
- Added new citation [29] Lee et al. (2022) to support the regulatory role of Rv0331 in stress response.
