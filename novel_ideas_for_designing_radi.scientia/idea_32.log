**Title**: Graphene-based Composite Materials with Enhanced Radiation Shielding Properties

**Key Idea**: Graphene-based composite materials can provide exceptional radiation shielding due to their high density, strength, and hydrogen content.

**Paragraph**: Graphene has been identified as a promising material for radiation shielding due to its exceptional mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties [5]. By incorporating graphene into composite materials and optimizing their structure, it may be possible to create lightweight, high-strength radiation shields with improved performance.

**Approach**: Investigate the radiation shielding properties of graphene-based composite materials using computational simulations and experimental validation. Focus on optimizing material composition for enhanced shielding effectiveness.

**Key References**: [5] [Liu 2020], [Patel 2020], [10] [Jiang 2021]

**Refinement**: 
- **Extended Application**: Emphasized optimization of graphene-based composites for enhanced shielding properties.
- **Strengthened Hypothesis**: Graphene composites offer a promising approach for lightweight and efficient radiation shielding.
