**Title**: Active Radiation Shielding with AI-Optimized Electric and Magnetic Field Configurations

**Key Idea**: Actively generating electric and magnetic fields around a spacecraft can effectively deflect or absorb charged radiation particles, reducing the need for passive shielding.

**Paragraph**: Active radiation shielding has been proposed as a means to enhance protection against space radiation [2]. By generating electric and magnetic fields, charged particles can be deflected or absorbed, potentially reducing the dose received by both humans and electronic systems. However, the effectiveness of this

**Approach**: depends on various factors, including field strength, configuration, and particle type. AI optimization can be used to find the most effective field configurations.

**Approach**: Develop and test an active shielding system using laboratory experiments and simulations to evaluate its performance against different types of radiation. Utilize machine learning algorithms to optimize field configurations.
