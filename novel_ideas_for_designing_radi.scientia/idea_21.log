**Title**: Enhanced Inflatable Radiation Shields with Multi-Layered Composites and In-Situ Resource Utilization

**Key Idea**: Inflatable radiation shields made from advanced multi-layered composites and integrated with in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) can provide effective protection against space radiation while reducing mass and volume.

**Paragraph**: Space radiation poses significant risks to both human health and electronic systems, making radiation shielding a critical component of deep space missions. Inflatable radiation shields offer a promising solution due to their potential for reduced mass and volume compared to traditional rigid shields. Recent studies have explored the use of advanced materials like multi-layered composites for radiation shielding [1]. By optimizing the design and material composition of inflatable shields and integrating ISRU, we can potentially achieve improved radiation protection while minimizing the impact on spacecraft mass and volume.

**Approach**: Utilize computational simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo methods) to model radiation interactions with various inflatable shield designs and materials. Experimental validation will be performed using particle accelerator tests. Integrate ISRU by incorporating local resources into the shield design.
