**Title**: AI-Optimized Radiation Shielding Materials for Deep Space Missions

**Key Idea**: Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to optimize radiation shielding material compositions for specific space missions, reducing mass and volume while improving protection.

**Paragraph**: Radiation shielding requirements vary significantly between different space missions, and optimizing shield design for specific missions can lead to significant reductions in mass and volume [8]. AI algorithms can be used to predict radiation shielding performance and identify optimal material compositions. By utilizing AI-optimized materials, it may be possible to create efficient radiation shields for deep space missions.

**Approach**: Develop and apply machine learning algorithms to optimize radiation shield material compositions for specific space missions.
