**Title**: Space-Time Adaptive Radiation Shielding using Metamaterials

**Key Idea**: Metamaterials can be engineered to have unique properties not found in nature, allowing for the creation of adaptive radiation shields that change configuration in space and time.

**Paragraph**: Metamaterials offer a promising

**Approach**: for creating adaptive radiation shields that can change configuration in response to changing radiation environments [11]. By designing metamaterials with specific properties, such as tunable density or refractive index, it may be possible to create shields that adapt to different types of radiation and provide optimal protection.

**Approach**: Investigate the properties of metamaterials for radiation shielding applications using computational simulations and experimental validation.
