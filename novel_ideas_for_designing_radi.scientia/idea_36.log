**Title**: Active Radiation Shielding with AI-Optimized Electric and Magnetic Field Configurations

**Key Idea**: Actively generating electric and magnetic fields around a spacecraft can effectively deflect or absorb charged radiation particles, reducing the need for passive shielding.

**Paragraph**: Active radiation shielding has been proposed as a means to enhance protection against space radiation [2]. By generating electric and magnetic fields, charged particles can be deflected or absorbed, potentially reducing the dose received by both humans and electronic systems. However, the effectiveness of this

**Approach**: depends on various factors, including field strength, configuration, and particle type. AI optimization can be used to find the most effective field configurations by analyzing vast datasets of radiation interactions.

**Approach**: Develop and test an active shielding system using laboratory experiments and simulations to evaluate its performance against different types of radiation. Utilize machine learning algorithms to optimize field configurations based on real-time radiation environment data.
