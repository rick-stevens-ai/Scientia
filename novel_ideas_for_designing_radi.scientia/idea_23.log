**Title**: Water-based Slurry Shields with Nanomaterial Enhancements for Improved Radiation Protection

**Key Idea**: Water can serve as an effective radiation shield due to its high hydrogen content, which provides excellent protection against both galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar particle events (SPEs).

**Paragraph**: Water has been identified as a promising material for radiation shielding due to its high hydrogen content, which provides excellent protection against both GCRs and SPEs [3]. By utilizing water as a shield material, spacecraft can potentially reduce the mass required for radiation protection while also providing a resource for life support and propulsion. The addition of nanomaterials can enhance the shielding properties.

**Approach**: Investigate the effectiveness of water-based slurry shields with nanomaterial enhancements using computational simulations and experimental validation.
