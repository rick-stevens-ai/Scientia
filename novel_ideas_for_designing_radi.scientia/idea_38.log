**Title**: Adaptive Radiation Shielding using Shape-Memory Alloys with Integrated Sensors

**Key Idea**: Shape-memory alloys can be used to create adaptive radiation shields that change configuration in response to changing radiation environments.

**Paragraph**: Shape-memory alloys offer a unique opportunity for adaptive radiation shielding due to their ability to change shape in response to temperature changes [4]. By integrating these materials into a radiation shield design and adding sensors for real-time monitoring, it may be possible to create shields that adapt to changing radiation environments, providing optimal protection while minimizing mass and volume.

**Approach**: Develop and test shape-memory alloy-based radiation shields using laboratory experiments and simulations. Integrate sensors for real-time monitoring of radiation levels and adjust shield configuration accordingly.
