**Title**: Biologically-Inspired Radiation Shielding using Self-Healing Materials

**Key Idea**: Self-healing materials can be used to create radiation shields that repair themselves in response to damage, enhancing mission sustainability.

**Paragraph**: Self-healing materials offer a unique opportunity for creating radiation shields that can repair themselves in response to damage [14]. By incorporating self-healing properties into radiation shield design, it may be possible to create shields that maintain their effectiveness over prolonged mission durations.

**Approach**: Investigate the properties of self-healing materials for radiation shielding applications using computational simulations and experimental validation.

**Key References**: [14] [Sun 2020], [15] [Wang 2022]

These refined and new ideas aim to strengthen the hypothesis and provide a more comprehensive approach to radiation shielding for deep space missions.
