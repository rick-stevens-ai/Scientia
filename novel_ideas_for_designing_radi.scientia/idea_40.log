**Title**: Radiation Shielding using Artificial Muscles and Soft Robotics

**Key Idea**: Artificial muscles and soft robotics can be used to create adaptive radiation shields that change configuration in response to changing radiation environments.

**Paragraph**: Artificial muscles and soft robotics offer a unique opportunity for creating adaptive radiation shields that can change shape and configuration in response to changing radiation environments [16]. By integrating these materials into a radiation shield design, it may be possible to create shields that provide optimal protection while minimizing mass and volume.

**Approach**: Investigate the properties of artificial muscles and soft robotics for radiation shielding applications using computational simulations and experimental validation.
