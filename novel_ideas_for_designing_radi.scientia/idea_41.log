**Title**: Hybrid Radiation Shielding using Multi-Functional Materials

**Key Idea**: Multi-functional materials can be used to create hybrid radiation shields that combine different shielding mechanisms, such as passive and active shielding.

**Paragraph**: Multi-functional materials offer a promising

**Approach**: for creating hybrid radiation shields that combine different shielding mechanisms [18]. By integrating multiple materials and shielding mechanisms, it may be possible to create shields that provide optimal protection while minimizing mass and volume.

**Approach**: Investigate the properties of multi-functional materials for radiation shielding applications using computational simulations and experimental validation.

**Key References**: [18] [Wang 2020], [19] [Zhang 2022]

These refined and new ideas aim to strengthen the hypothesis and provide a more comprehensive approach to radiation shielding for deep space missions.
