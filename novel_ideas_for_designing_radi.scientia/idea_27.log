**Title**: Self-Sustaining Inflatable Radiation Shields for Deep Space Missions

**Key Idea**: Inflatable radiation shields can be integrated with power generation and energy storage systems to provide a self-sustaining solution for deep space missions.

**Paragraph**: Inflatable radiation shields offer a promising solution for deep space missions due to their potential for reduced mass and volume [13]. By integrating power generation and energy storage systems, such as solar panels and batteries, into the shield design, it may be possible to create self-sustaining radiation shields that provide both protection and power.

**Approach**: Investigate the feasibility of integrating power generation and energy storage systems into inflatable radiation shields using computational simulations and experimental validation.
