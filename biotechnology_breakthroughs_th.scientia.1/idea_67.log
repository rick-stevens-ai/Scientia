**Paragraph**: **  
Ensuring industrial safety demands rapid, multiplexed detection of diverse hazardous compounds. AI-driven discovery engines can design novel protein or aptamer-based biosensors, evolving them for high affinity, specificity, and signal robustness. Integration with sensor fusion and adaptive calibration algorithms enables these biosensors to deliver real-time, multi-analyte monitoring with high accuracy, even in complex, fluctuating environments. Digital twin deployment simulations enhance reliability and facilitate regulatory compliance, while modular interfaces ensure interoperability with existing safety infrastructure [Krawczyk 2018; Zhang 2021; Giordano 2020].
