**Paragraph**: **  
Protein-based nanomaterials offer tunable physicochemical and biological properties, yet their rational design and translation to industry or clinic is challenging. AI-powered laboratories can autonomously design, synthesize, and evaluate self-assembling protein nanostructures, uncovering sequence–structure–function relationships and creating devices with bespoke functions. By integrating manufacturability, scalability, and end-use stability modeling, these platforms ensure that discovered nanomaterials are viable for real-world deployment. Standardized protein scaffolds further streamline design and production, accelerating the path from concept to application in medicine, energy, and materials science [Huang 2016; Huang 2022; Dou 2021].
