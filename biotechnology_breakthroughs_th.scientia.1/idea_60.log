**Key Idea**: **Modifications & Strengthening:**  
- Extended by explicitly including end-use stability (thermal, chemical, shelf-life) modeling, facilitating translation to real-world products.
- Simplified by proposing standardized protein scaffolds to enable plug-and-play assembly.
- Combined manufacturability assessment and stability prediction to streamline go/no-go decisions for scale-up.
