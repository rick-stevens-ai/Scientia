**Paragraph**: **  
The need for sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics is driving the quest for novel biopolymers with tailored mechanical, degradation, and environmental profiles. Next-generation AI-driven autonomous laboratories can systematically explore and optimize combinatorial biosynthetic pathways in engineered microorganisms, using generative models to propose novel monomer sequences. These platforms further integrate automated lifecycle and environmental impact assessments, as well as regulatory compliance checks, enabling the prioritization of candidates that are not only high-performing and eco-friendly but also rapidly approvable for market deployment. Modular biomanufacturing systems can translate lab-scale discoveries to industrial production, closing the loop for accelerated sustainable material innovation [Zhang 2020; WÃ¤ger 2020; Myung 2022].
