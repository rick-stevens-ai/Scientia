**Paragraph**: **  
Industrial safety requires robust, adaptive detection of hazardous compounds across complex environments. AI-powered platforms can design and evolve synthetic protein or aptamer-based biosensors with high affinity, specificity, and multiplexing capability. Integration with adaptive calibration, self-diagnosis, and digital twin deployment simulations ensures accurate, reliable performance in variable field conditions. AI-driven network optimization algorithms determine optimal sensor placement and redundancy for comprehensive coverage, while automated interoperability testing expedites integration with legacy safety systems. Predictive maintenance and calibration analytics further reduce downtime and false alarms, elevating industrial safety to new standards [Krawczyk 2018; Zhang 2021; Giordano 2020; Gubbi 2013].

**Approach**: expedites integration with legacy safety systems. Predictive maintenance and calibration analytics further reduce downtime and false alarms, elevating industrial safety to new standards [Krawczyk 2018; Zhang 2021; Giordano 2020; Gubbi 2013].
