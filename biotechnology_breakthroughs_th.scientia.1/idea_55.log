**Paragraph**: **  
Enzyme catalysis is the cornerstone of green chemistry, but bottlenecks in discovery and process integration persist. Autonomous AI factories harness deep learning and robotic platforms to design, express, and screen enzyme libraries, rapidly identifying candidates with target activity and substrate scope. By integrating in silico substrate specificity mapping, downstream process compatibility analysis, and automated techno-economic and environmental modeling, these platforms ensure that discovered enzymes are not only effective but also viable and sustainable for industrial deployment. A feedback loop from process simulation data further optimizes enzyme properties for real-world conditions, bridging the gap between discovery and application [Arnold 2018; Wu 2019; Finnigan 2020].
