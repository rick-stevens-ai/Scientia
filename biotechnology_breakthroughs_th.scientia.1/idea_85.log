**Paragraph**: **  
Enzyme catalysis underpins green and sustainable chemistry, but the pathway from discovery to industrial implementation is fraught with challenges. Modern autonomous AI platforms combine deep learning, robotic screening, and high-throughput analytics to design, express, and evolve enzyme libraries. These platforms integrate in silico substrate mapping, manufacturability and stability prediction, compatibility with downstream processes, and techno-economic and environmental modeling to ensure industrial viability. Embedded regulatory and safety assessment modules accelerate compliance and reduce risks. Iterative feedback from process simulations and stress testing under industrial conditions further optimize enzyme candidates, bridging the gap between innovation and real-world application [Arnold 2018; Wu 2019; Finnigan 2020; Bornscheuer 2022].
