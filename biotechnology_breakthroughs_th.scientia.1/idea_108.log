**Paragraph**: **  
While bioplastics offer sustainability advantages, many still end up in landfills due to inadequate recycling infrastructure. AI-enabled platforms can address this by designing both the polymers and their recycling/degradation pathways, engineering microbial or enzymatic consortia for targeted depolymerization and upcycling. Predictive models guide the selection of optimal recycling strategies based on regional waste profiles and environmental conditions, while automated LCA modules quantify the net ecological benefits. This

**Approach**: closes the loop for biopolymers, transforming waste into new feedstocks and minimizing resource consumption [Tiso 2021; Wei 2022; Singh 2023].
