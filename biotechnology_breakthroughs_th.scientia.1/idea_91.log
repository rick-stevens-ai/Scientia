**Paragraph**: **  
Protein-based nanomaterials possess exceptional tunability for diverse applications, but their translation to real-world use is hampered by stability, scalability, and regulatory hurdles. AI-powered labs can autonomously design, synthesize, and optimize self-assembling protein nanostructures, uncovering relationships between sequence, structure, and function. By embedding application-specific stability models, manufacturability, and scalability assessment, these platforms prioritize candidates that are robust in their intended contexts. Pre-selected, adaptable scaffold families streamline the initial design while regulatory and end-use simulations address approval and safety concerns early in development, expediting the pathway to industrial and biomedical adoption [Huang 2016; Huang 2022; Dou 2018; Walsh 2022].
