**Paragraph**: **  
The urgent need for sustainable alternatives to petrochemical plastics drives innovation in biopolymer design. Next-generation AI-driven autonomous laboratories can systematically explore and optimize biosynthetic pathways in engineered microorganisms, leveraging generative models to propose novel monomer sequences with tailored properties. By integrating automated lifecycle assessment (LCA), end-of-life fate modeling, environmental impact, and regulatory compliance checks, these platforms prioritize candidates that are both high-performing and environmentally benign. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) modules and market readiness scoring guide the selection of scalable and cost-effective bioplastics, while modular biomanufacturing systems facilitate rapid translation from lab to industrial scale. This holistic, closed-loop

**Approach**: accelerates the development and deployment of sustainable materials with genuine circularity [Zhang 2020; WÃ¤ger 2020; Myung 2022; Ragaert 2017; Walker 2022].
