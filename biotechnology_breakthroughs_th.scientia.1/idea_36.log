**Paragraph**: ** Protein-based nanomaterials offer unique physicochemical properties, but their rational design and industrial translation are complex. AI factories can autonomously model, synthesize, and characterize self-assembling protein nanostructures, enabling rapid exploration of sequence–structure–function relationships and the creation of novel nanodevices. By integrating manufacturability and scale-up modeling, these systems ensure that discovered nanomaterials are not only functional but also viable for industrial-scale production [Huang 2016; Huang 2022].
