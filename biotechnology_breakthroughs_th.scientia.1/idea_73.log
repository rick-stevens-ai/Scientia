Fragrance and flavor industries are shifting toward sustainable, bio-based production, but microbial synthesis of complex blends remains a challenge. AI factories can design and optimize metabolic pathways in microbial cell factories, leveraging co-culture and consortia engineering to enable the biosynthesis of complex, multi-component fragrance profiles. Automated downstream purification and product formulation platforms further ensure consistency, regulatory compliance, and scalability. Real-time sensory analytics provide feedback for iterative improvement, ensuring high-quality, reproducible fragrance products [Carbonell 2018; Nielsen 2021; Jones 2022].
