# Final Report: Idea 28

## Final ELO Score: 1536.2

## Final Hypothesis

**Paragraph**: **  
The shift toward bio-based fragrance production demands flexible platforms capable of generating complex, consistent, and market-ready blends. AI-driven metabolic engineering, co-culture design, and automated purification enable efficient biosynthesis of diverse fragrance molecules. Integration with real-time process analytical technology (PAT) and consumer sensory preference prediction allows for closed-loop adjustment of formulations, ensuring both quality and market alignment. Automated regulatory feedback and compliance modules further streamline approval, while iterative optimization of strains, pathways, and formulations guarantees reproducibility and scalability. This holistic

**Approach**: redefines the fragrance industry, delivering sustainability, consistency, and consumer-centric products [Carbonell 2018; Nielsen 2021; Jones 2022; Rathore 2022; Choudhury 2020].
