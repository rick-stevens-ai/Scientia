**Approach**: **  
Implement closed-loop robotic labs employing generative ML models for biopolymer design, property predictors, automated LCA/EOL and regulatory modules, TEA, and modular biomanufacturing. Use market readiness scoring to prioritize candidates. Iteratively design, test, and scale bioplastics with targeted properties and minimal ecological impact.
