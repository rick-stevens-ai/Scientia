**Paragraph**: ** Workplace safety in industries involving volatile or toxic compounds can be improved by biosensors that rapidly and selectively detect multiple contaminants. AI-driven discovery engines can rapidly design novel sensing elements (e.g., protein or aptamer-based sensors) with high affinity and specificity. By using sensor fusion and multiplexing strategies, these platforms can deliver robust, real-time safety monitoring across a wider range of industrial threats [Krawczyk 2018; Zhang 2021].
