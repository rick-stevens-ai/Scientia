**Title**: Dark Matter from Compact Extra Dimensions with Enhanced Astrophysical Signatures
-

**Key Idea**: Compact extra dimensions can provide a mechanism for generating dark matter through the interaction of branes with the standard model, potentially enhancing astrophysical signatures.
-

**Paragraph**: Compact extra dimensions are hypothetical objects that can provide a mechanism for generating dark matter [Arkani-Hamed et al. 1999]. Recent studies suggest that compact extra dimensions could provide a significant component of dark matter [Dvali et al. 2000]. Incorporating enhanced astrophysical signatures can provide more robust evidence for compact extra dimension dark matter.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of compact extra dimension dark matter with enhanced astrophysical signatures through cosmological observations and theoretical modeling.
