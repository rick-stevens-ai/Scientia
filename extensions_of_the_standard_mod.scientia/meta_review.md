### 2. Idea (ELO: 1538.0)

**Title**: Axion-Higgs Portal to Dark Matter with Enhanced Collider Signatures, Extended Higgs Sector, and QCD Axion Connections
-

**Key Idea**: The axion-Higgs portal provides a mechanism for dark matter to interact with the standard model through the Higgs boson and QCD axions, potentially enhancing collider signatures by incorporating additional Higgs-like scalars and axion-gluon interactions.
-

**Paragraph**: The standard model of particle physics is incomplete, as it does not account for dark matter, which makes up approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy density [Bertone & Hooper 2016]. One possible extension is the axion-Higgs portal, which proposes that axions, hypothetical particles, interact with the Higgs boson to facilitate dark matter interactions with the standard model [Bae et al. 2013]. This interaction could help explain the observed properties of dark matter. Recent studies suggest that the axion-Higgs portal could also enhance collider signatures, making it more detectable [Bauer et al. 2020]. By incorporating an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs-like scalars and QCD axion connections, the model can provide more robust signatures for detection [Craig et al. 2019].
-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of the axion-Higgs portal with an extended Higgs sector, QCD axion connections, and axion-gluon interactions through collider searches, focusing on enhanced signatures, and cosmological observations.
