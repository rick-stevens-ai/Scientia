**Title**: Mirror Dark Matter with Kinetic Mixing and Enhanced Cosmological Signatures
-

**Key Idea**: Mirror dark matter can interact with the standard model through kinetic mixing, providing a mechanism for dark matter to interact with normal matter and enhanced cosmological signatures.
-

**Paragraph**: Mirror dark matter proposes the existence of a hidden sector that interacts with the standard model through kinetic mixing [Blum et al. 2016]. This interaction could help explain the observed properties of dark matter and provide additional detection signatures. Recent studies suggest that enhanced cosmological signatures could provide more robust evidence for mirror dark matter [Cline et al. 2020].
-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of mirror dark matter with kinetic mixing through direct detection experiments, cosmological observations, and enhanced cosmological signatures.
