**Title**: Mirror Dark Matter with Kinetic Mixing

-

**Key Idea**: Mirror dark matter can interact with the standard model through kinetic mixing, providing a mechanism for dark matter to interact with normal matter.

-

**Paragraph**: Mirror dark matter proposes the existence of a hidden sector that interacts with the standard model through kinetic mixing [Blum et al. 2016]. This interaction could help explain the observed properties of dark matter and provide additional detection signatures.

-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of mirror dark matter with kinetic mixing through direct detection experiments and cosmological observations.
