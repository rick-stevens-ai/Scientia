# Final Report: Idea 8

## Final ELO Score: 1514.8

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Axionic Dark Matter with Topological Defects, Enhanced Cosmological Signatures, and Axion-Gluon Interactions
-

**Key Idea**: Axionic dark matter can be generated through the formation of topological defects with enhanced cosmological signatures and axion-gluon interactions.
-

**Paragraph**: Axions are well-motivated dark matter candidates that can be generated through the formation of topological defects [Kibble 1976]. Recent studies suggest that axionic dark matter could provide a mechanism for explaining the observed properties of dark matter [Guth et al. 2015]. Incorporating enhanced cosmological signatures and axion-gluon interactions can provide more robust evidence for axionic dark matter [Gleiser et al. 2020].
-

**Approach**: Explore the connections between axionic dark matter, topological defects, enhanced cosmological signatures, and axion-gluon interactions through cosmological observations and theoretical modeling.
