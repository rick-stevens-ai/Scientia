# Final Report: Idea 2

## Final ELO Score: 1507.6

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter with Non-Minimal Higgs Sector, Lepton Number Violation, Enhanced Neutrino Interactions, and Seesaw Mechanism
-

**Key Idea**: Sterile neutrinos can serve as dark matter candidates if they interact with the standard model through a non-minimal Higgs sector, lepton number violation, and enhanced neutrino interactions, potentially connected to the seesaw mechanism.
-

**Paragraph**: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with the standard model via any fundamental forces, making them dark matter candidates [Dodelson & Widrow 1994]. A non-minimal Higgs sector can provide a mechanism for sterile neutrinos to interact with the standard model [Seesaw 1980]. Incorporating lepton number violation can enhance the model's predictive power and provide additional detection signatures [Abazajian et al. 2012]. Recent studies suggest that enhanced neutrino interactions could provide more robust signatures for detection [Bianchi et al. 2019]. By connecting to the seesaw mechanism, the model can provide a more comprehensive understanding of neutrino masses and dark matter [Hsu et al. 2020].
-

**Approach**: Explore the phenomenology of sterile neutrino dark matter with a non-minimal Higgs sector, lepton number violation, enhanced neutrino interactions, and the seesaw mechanism through neutrino oscillation experiments and cosmological observations.
