**Title**: Tachyonic Dark Matter with Modified Gravity
-

**Key Idea**: Tachyonic fields can serve as dark matter candidates if they interact with the standard model through modified gravity.
-

**Paragraph**: Tachyonic fields are hypothetical objects that can provide a mechanism for generating dark matter [Padmanabhan 2002]. Recent studies suggest that modified gravity theories can enhance the model's predictive power and provide additional detection signatures [Brax et al. 2011].
-

**Approach**: Explore the connections between tachyonic dark matter and modified gravity through cosmological observations and theoretical modeling.
