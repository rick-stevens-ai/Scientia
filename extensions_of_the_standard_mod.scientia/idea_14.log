**Title**: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter with Flavor-Dependent Interactions and Enhanced Neutrino Signatures
-

**Key Idea**: Sterile neutrinos can serve as dark matter candidates if they interact with the standard model through flavor-dependent interactions, potentially enhancing neutrino signatures.
-

**Paragraph**: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with the standard model via any fundamental forces, making them dark matter candidates [Dodelson & Widrow 1994]. Recent studies suggest that flavor-dependent interactions can enhance the model's predictive power and provide additional detection signatures [Abazajian et al. 2012]. By connecting to enhanced neutrino signatures, the model can provide more robust evidence for sterile neutrino dark matter.
-

**Approach**: Explore the phenomenology of sterile neutrino dark matter with flavor-dependent interactions and enhanced neutrino signatures through neutrino oscillation experiments and cosmological observations.

**Title**: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter with Flavor-Dependent Interactions and Enhanced Neutrino Signatures
-

**Key Idea**: Sterile neutrinos can serve as dark matter candidates if they interact with the standard model through flavor-dependent interactions, potentially enhancing neutrino signatures.
-

**Paragraph**: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with the standard model via any fundamental forces, making them dark matter candidates [Dodelson & Widrow 1994]. Recent studies suggest that flavor-dependent interactions can enhance the model's predictive power and provide additional detection signatures [Abazajian et al. 2012]. By connecting to enhanced neutrino signatures, the model can provide more robust evidence for sterile neutrino dark matter.

## Rationale for Placement

The ranking is based on a comprehensive evaluation of each idea across the eight key criteria. The top-ranked ideas (1-5) demonstrate a strong hypothesis plausibility, novelty, and likelihood of correctness, along with a good methodological rigor, resource efficiency, potential impact, interdisciplinary potential, and scalability.

The middle-ranked ideas (6-10) show some promise but have limitations in one or more of the criteria. For instance, ideas 6 and 7 have relatively lower resource efficiency and scalability.

The lower-ranked ideas (11-16) have significant limitations in their hypothesis plausibility, methodological rigor, or potential impact, making them less competitive.

This interim ranking provides a feedback mechanism for the researchers to refine their ideas and approaches before proceeding to the next round.
