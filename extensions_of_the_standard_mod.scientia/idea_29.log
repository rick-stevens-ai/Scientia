**Title**: Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter

-

**Key Idea**: Primordial black holes can serve as dark matter candidates if they formed in the early universe.

-

**Paragraph**: Primordial black holes are hypothetical objects that could have formed in the early universe, providing a mechanism for generating dark matter [Carr et al. 2010]. Recent studies suggest that primordial black holes could provide a significant component of dark matter [Inoue & Kofman 2002].

-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of primordial black hole dark matter through cosmological observations and theoretical modeling.
