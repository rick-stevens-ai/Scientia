# Final Report: Idea 3

## Final ELO Score: 1487.6

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Dark Matter from Asymmetric Dark Sectors with Baryogenesis Connections, Electroweak-Scale Interactions, and Dark Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry
-

**Key Idea**: Asymmetric dark sectors can provide a mechanism for generating dark matter through the imbalance of dark matter and dark antimatter, potentially connected to baryogenesis, electroweak-scale interactions, and dark matter-antimatter asymmetry.
-

**Paragraph**: The standard model does not provide a mechanism for generating the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter [Hawking 2005]. Asymmetric dark sectors propose that dark matter and dark antimatter are generated through a similar mechanism, leading to an imbalance that results in the observed dark matter density [Gu & McDermott 2016]. Recent studies suggest connections to baryogenesis, which could provide additional insights into the matter-antimatter asymmetry [Hsu et al. 2020]. Incorporating electroweak-scale interactions and dark matter-antimatter asymmetry can enhance the model's predictive power and provide more robust signatures for detection [Cline & Wolfram 2020].
-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of asymmetric dark sectors and their connections to baryogenesis, electroweak-scale interactions, and dark matter-antimatter asymmetry through cosmological observations and direct detection experiments.
