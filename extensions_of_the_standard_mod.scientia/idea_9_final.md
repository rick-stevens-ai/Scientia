## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter with Enhanced Astrophysical Signatures, Black Hole Formation, and Gravitational Waves
-

**Key Idea**: Primordial black holes can serve as dark matter candidates if they formed in the early universe, potentially with enhanced astrophysical signatures, black hole formation, and connections to gravitational waves.
-

**Paragraph**: Primordial black holes are hypothetical objects that could have formed in the early universe, providing a mechanism for generating dark matter [Carr et al. 2010]. Recent studies suggest that primordial black holes could provide a significant component of dark matter [Inoue & Kofman 2002]. Incorporating enhanced astrophysical signatures, black hole formation, and connections to gravitational waves can provide more robust evidence for primordial black hole dark matter [Carr et al. 2020].
-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of primordial black hole dark matter with enhanced astrophysical signatures, black hole formation, and connections to gravitational waves through cosmological observations and theoretical modeling.
