# Final Report: Idea 13

## Final ELO Score: 1490.1

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Dark Matter from Non-Abelian Gauge Fields with Enhanced Direct Detection Signatures
-

**Key Idea**: Non-Abelian gauge fields can provide a mechanism for generating dark matter through the interaction of gauge fields with the standard model, potentially enhancing direct detection signatures.
-

**Paragraph**: Non-Abelian gauge fields are hypothetical objects that can provide a mechanism for generating dark matter [Gudnason et al. 2016]. Recent studies suggest that non-Abelian gauge fields could provide a significant component of dark matter [Cai et al. 2019]. Incorporating enhanced direct detection signatures can provide more robust evidence for non-Abelian gauge field dark matter.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of non-Abelian gauge field dark matter with enhanced direct detection signatures through direct detection experiments and cosmological observations.
