**Title**: Axionic Dark Matter with Topological Defects and Enhanced Cosmological Signatures
-

**Key Idea**: Axionic dark matter can be generated through the formation of topological defects with enhanced cosmological signatures.
-

**Paragraph**: Axions are well-motivated dark matter candidates that can be generated through the formation of topological defects [Kibble 1976]. Recent studies suggest that axionic dark matter could provide a mechanism for explaining the observed properties of dark matter [Guth et al. 2015]. Incorporating enhanced cosmological signatures can provide more robust evidence for axionic dark matter.
-

**Approach**: Explore the connections between axionic dark matter, topological defects, and enhanced cosmological signatures through cosmological observations and theoretical modeling.
