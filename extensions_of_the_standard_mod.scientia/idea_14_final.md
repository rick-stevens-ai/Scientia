## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter with Flavor-Dependent Interactions and Enhanced Neutrino Signatures
-

**Key Idea**: Sterile neutrinos can serve as dark matter candidates if they interact with the standard model through flavor-dependent interactions, potentially enhancing neutrino signatures.
-

**Paragraph**: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact with the standard model via any fundamental forces, making them dark matter candidates [Dodelson & Widrow 1994]. Recent studies suggest that flavor-dependent interactions can enhance the model's predictive power and provide additional detection signatures [Abazajian et al. 2012]. By connecting to enhanced neutrino signatures, the model can provide more robust evidence for sterile neutrino dark matter.
-

**Approach**: Explore the phenomenology of sterile neutrino dark matter with flavor-dependent interactions and enhanced neutrino signatures through neutrino oscillation experiments and cosmological observations.
