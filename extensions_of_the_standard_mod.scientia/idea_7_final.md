## Final ELO Score: 1520.0

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Dark Photon Dark Matter with Enhanced Direct Detection Signatures, Light Mediators, and Kinetic Mixing
-

**Key Idea**: Dark photons can serve as dark matter candidates if they interact with the standard model through kinetic mixing and light mediators, potentially enhancing direct detection signatures.
-

**Paragraph**: Dark photons are hypothetical particles that interact with the standard model through kinetic mixing, making them dark matter candidates [Pospelov 2008]. Recent studies suggest that dark photons could provide a mechanism for generating dark matter [Feng et al. 2017]. Incorporating light mediators can enhance direct detection signatures [Knappe et al. 2020].
-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of dark photon dark matter with light mediators and kinetic mixing through direct detection experiments and cosmological observations.
