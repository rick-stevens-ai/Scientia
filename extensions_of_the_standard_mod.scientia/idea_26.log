**Title**: Dark Matter from Gravitational Waves

-

**Key Idea**: Gravitational waves can provide a mechanism for generating dark matter through the decay of heavy particles.

-

**Paragraph**: Recent observations of gravitational waves by LIGO and VIRGO have opened a new window into the universe [Abbott et al. 2016]. A novel idea is that gravitational waves could have played a role in generating dark matter through the decay of heavy particles [Buchmüller et al. 2019].

-

**Approach**: Explore the connections between gravitational waves, heavy particle decay, and dark matter generation through cosmological observations and theoretical modeling.
