**Title**: Dark Photon Dark Matter

-

**Key Idea**: Dark photons can serve as dark matter candidates if they interact with the standard model through kinetic mixing.

-

**Paragraph**: Dark photons are hypothetical particles that interact with the standard model through kinetic mixing, making them dark matter candidates [Pospelov 2008]. Recent studies suggest that dark photons could provide a mechanism for generating dark matter [Feng et al. 2017].

-

**Approach**: Investigate the phenomenology of dark photon dark matter through direct detection experiments and cosmological observations.
