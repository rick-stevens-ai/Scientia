**Title**: Dark Matter from Gravitational Waves with Primordial Black Hole Connections
-

**Key Idea**: Gravitational waves can provide a mechanism for generating dark matter through the decay of heavy particles, potentially connected to primordial black holes.
-

**Paragraph**: Recent observations of gravitational waves by LIGO and VIRGO have opened a new window into the universe [Abbott et al. 2016]. A novel idea is that gravitational waves could have played a role in generating dark matter through the decay of heavy particles [Buchmüller et al. 2019]. Incorporating primordial black holes can provide additional insights into the generation of dark matter.
-

**Approach**: Explore the connections between gravitational waves, heavy particle decay, primordial black holes, and dark matter generation through cosmological observations and theoretical modeling.
