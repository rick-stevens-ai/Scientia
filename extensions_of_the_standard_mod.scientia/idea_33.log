**Title**: WIMP Dark Matter with Non-Universal Couplings, Enhanced Direct Detection Signatures, and Light Mediators
-

**Key Idea**: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) can serve as dark matter candidates if they have non-universal couplings to the standard model, potentially enhancing direct detection signatures through light mediators.
-

**Paragraph**: WIMPs are well-motivated dark matter candidates that interact with the standard model through the weak nuclear force and/or the Higgs boson [Bertone & Hooper 2016]. Non-universal couplings can provide a mechanism for WIMPs to interact with the standard model while evading detection [Cao et al. 2009]. Recent studies suggest that non-universal couplings could also enhance direct detection signatures [Fan et al. 2010]. Incorporating light mediators can provide more robust signatures for detection.
-

**Approach**: Explore the phenomenology of WIMP dark matter with non-universal couplings and light mediators through collider searches and direct detection experiments, focusing on enhanced signatures.
