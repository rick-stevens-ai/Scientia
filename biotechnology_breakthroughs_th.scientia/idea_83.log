**Title**: AI-Enabled Autonomous Systems for Optimization of Water Reuse in Industrial Bioprocesses

**Key Idea**: Autonomous AI platforms can design, monitor, and optimize industrial bioprocess water reuse systems, integrating advanced biotreatment and adaptive control for maximal sustainability.

**Paragraph**: Water scarcity and pollution are critical challenges for industrial bioprocessing, where water use and disposal represent major environmental and economic burdens. AI-driven autonomous laboratories can optimize water reuse systems by combining advanced biotreatment (e.g., engineered microbes/materials for contaminant removal) with adaptive process control and real-time water quality monitoring. This can enable continuous, safe reuse of process water, reduce freshwater demand, and minimize discharge of pollutants, supporting sustainability and regulatory compliance in next-generation industrial biomanufacturing.

**Approach**: Integrate AI-guided optimization of biotreatment modules (microbial and material-based) with automated process control and real-time water analytics. Use closed-loop adaptive algorithms to maximize water reuse efficiency and minimize contaminant breakthrough. Validate systems in pilot industrial setups with varying waste loads and water quality requirements.
