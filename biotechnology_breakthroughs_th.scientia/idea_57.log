**Paragraph**: Microbial communities can achieve biotransformations and process resilience that single strains cannot, yet rational design of industrial consortia is hampered by unpredictable interactions and environmental variability. AI-factories can automate the design, assembly, and adaptive optimization of synthetic microbial communities, leveraging real-time multi-omics, ecological modeling, and adaptive laboratory evolution to boost stability, productivity, and resilience. This

**Approach**: enables efficient conversion of diverse waste streams, production of bio-based chemicals, plastics, and fuels, and enhances resource recoveryâ€”moving industrial bioprocessing far beyond traditional agriculture or health applications.
