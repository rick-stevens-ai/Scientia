**Paragraph**: Enzymes are critical for efficient, sustainable industrial processes, but conventional discovery and optimization are slow and limited in scope. Integrating AI-driven autonomous labs with high-throughput screening, generative modeling, and multi-objective optimization enables rapid engineering of enzymes with enhanced activity, specificity, stability, and compatibility for diverse industrial applicationsâ€”including textiles, chemicals, plastics recycling, and novel biotransformations. By explicitly targeting new-to-nature activities and circular economy goals, these platforms can uncover biocatalysts capable of processing unconventional substrates, reducing waste, and supporting greener manufacturing processes. Incorporating real-time feedback and iterative improvement further accelerates discovery and ensures industrial robustness.
