**Title**: Autonomous AI Platforms for Biotechnological Upcycling of Industrial CO₂ Emissions

**Key Idea**: AI-driven autonomous systems can engineer and optimize biological or hybrid processes for upcycling industrial CO₂ emissions into high-value chemicals, fuels, or materials.

**Paragraph**: Capturing and upcycling CO₂ emissions is a central challenge for decarbonizing industry. Autonomous AI platforms can design, synthesize, and evolve biocatalysts, microbial communities, or enzyme–material hybrids capable of converting CO₂ into valuable commodities such as platform chemicals, polymers, or biofuels. Through continuous, data-driven optimization and integration with process analytics, these systems can accelerate the translation from laboratory breakthroughs to scalable industrial solutions, offering a direct path to reducing industrial carbon footprints and creating economic value from waste carbon.

**Approach**: Utilize AI-guided protein/enzyme engineering, metabolic pathway optimization, and hybrid catalyst discovery in automated closed-loop workflows. Integrate real-time process analytics for CO₂ capture and conversion efficiency, with multi-objective optimization for yield, selectivity, and scalability. Demonstrate and optimize in pilot-scale industrial CO₂ upcycling setups.
