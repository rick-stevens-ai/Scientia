**Title**: Autonomous AI Platforms for the Design and Integration of Protein-Based Bioelectronic and Biophotonic Materials

**Key Idea**: AI-driven autonomous platforms can design, synthesize, and optimize protein structures with specific and tunable electronic or photonic properties—enabling scalable, integrable bioelectronic and biophotonic devices for industry.

**Paragraph**: Bioelectronics and biophotonics are rapidly advancing fields that require materials with highly specific, tunable, and integrable electronic or optical properties. Autonomous AI laboratories can be harnessed to design and synthesize proteins or peptides with tailored charge transport, fluorescence, or light-absorption characteristics. By integrating device-level simulation and rapid prototyping, these platforms bridge the gap between molecular design and real-world device application, enabling development of innovative, environmentally friendly components for sensors, computing, energy harvesting, and advanced displays. AI-driven structure–function prediction, coupled with device-level modeling and high-throughput testing, accelerates the discovery and translation of new protein-based materials to scalable industrial devices.

**Approach**: Implement closed-loop AI design and robotic synthesis/testing cycles, targeting protein variants with desired electronic/optical metrics. Integrate rapid device prototyping and simulation for functional validation. Use AI-driven structure–property mapping and device-level modeling to prioritize candidates for scalability and practical integration, and validate performance in relevant device contexts.
