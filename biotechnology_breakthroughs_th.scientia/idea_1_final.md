## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Autonomous AI Laboratories for Multi-Objective Enzyme Engineering and Circular Bioeconomy Integration

**Key Idea**: Autonomous AI laboratories can rapidly engineer, evolve, and optimize novel enzymes with new-to-nature activities and multi-objective performance—explicitly targeting sustainable industrial manufacturing, recyclability, and circular economy applications.

**Paragraph**: Enzymes are indispensable for efficient and sustainable industrial processes, yet conventional discovery and optimization are slow, limiting their potential impact on emerging challenges such as waste valorization and circular manufacturing. By integrating AI-driven autonomous laboratories with high-throughput screening, generative protein modeling, and multi-objective optimization, enzymes can be engineered to exhibit enhanced activity, selectivity, stability, and compatibility for diverse industrial applications—including textiles, chemicals, plastics recycling, and biotransformations. This

**Approach**: explicitly incorporates sustainability metrics and recyclability (such as enzyme reusability, process integration, and end-of-life enzyme degradation) as core objectives. Real-time feedback and iterative improvement cycles further accelerate enzyme discovery, ensuring robustness under industrial conditions and supporting greener manufacturing paradigms. The strategy expands to the evolution of enzymes capable of new-to-nature activities, such as depolymerization of recalcitrant plastics or conversion of industrial waste streams, directly contributing to the development of a circular bioeconomy.

**Approach**: Deploy AI-driven robotic platforms to design, synthesize, and screen enzyme variants using both directed evolution and generative models. Integrate real-time, multi-parametric data (activity, stability, substrate scope, recyclability, lifecycle impact) with multi-objective optimization to balance catalytic efficiency, industrial robustness, and sustainability. Assess enzyme performance in realistic process conditions, including recyclability, process integration, and enzyme longevity. Incorporate environmental and lifecycle analysis tools to quantify circular economy impact at each iteration.

**Modifications/Strengthening**:
- Explicitly incorporated sustainability and lifecycle analysis as optimization objectives.
- Added references on enzyme recycling and circular bioeconomy.
- Extended scope to new-to-nature activities and waste stream valorization.
