**Approach**: Combine AI-driven protein engineering with materials informatics to design enzymeâ€“material hybrid candidates. Automate synthesis and high-throughput screening for catalytic and material properties (e.g., mechanical strength, conductivity, recyclability). Use iterative AI optimization to balance function and sustainability, validating top candidates in pilot-scale circular manufacturing processes.
