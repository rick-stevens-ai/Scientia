**Paragraph**: Living materials, which combine engineered biological systems with functional scaffolds, offer dynamic properties such as self-healing, sensing, and environmental responsiveness. AI-guided platforms can systematically design and evolve these materials to optimize adaptive behaviors (e.g., self-repair after damage, real-time sensing of pollutants, or dynamic insulation) suitable for infrastructure applications. Autonomous labs allow for rapid prototyping and iterative testing of both biological and material components, enabling the creation of smart, sustainable building materials that can prolong infrastructure lifespan and reduce maintenance costs.

**Approach**: of both biological and material components, enabling the creation of smart, sustainable building materials that can prolong infrastructure lifespan and reduce maintenance costs.
