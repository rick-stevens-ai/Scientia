**Title**: Autonomous AI-Driven Platforms for Sustainable and Recyclable Biomaterial Discovery

**Key Idea**: AI-powered autonomous laboratories can discover and optimize novel protein- and polymer-based biomaterials with tailored mechanical, functional, and environmental properties, directly integrating lifecycle analysis, biodegradability, and recyclability for broad industrial applications.

**Paragraph**: The demand for innovative, sustainable biomaterials is rapidly increasing across electronics, construction, consumer goods, and packaging. Autonomous AI laboratories can design, synthesize, and characterize new protein and polymer sequences, optimizing for advanced properties such as elasticity, conductivity, self-healing, and biodegradability. By embedding environmental impact assessments, lifecycle analysis, and recyclability as core criteria in the discovery process, these platforms can generate materials that are both high-performing and environmentally sustainable. This proactive integration of end-of-life and recycling pathways during material design overcomes the limitations of traditional materials development, enabling the creation of next-generation biomaterials that minimize environmental footprints and support a circular economy.

**Approach**: Integrate AI-guided generative design with automated synthesis, high-throughput testing, and real-time environmental/lifecycle assessments. Employ machine learning for rapid structureâ€“property prediction and multi-objective optimization to prioritize both performance and sustainability. Iteratively refine candidates using feedback from recyclability and biodegradability tests, and validate top materials in pilot-scale applications.
