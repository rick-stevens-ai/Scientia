**Title**: AI-Driven Autonomous Discovery of Biodegradable and Functional Coatings for Industrial Applications

**Key Idea**: Autonomous AI labs can design and optimize biodegradable coatings with tunable surface functionalities (e.g., antimicrobial, anti-corrosive, self-cleaning), directly targeting end-of-life degradability and industrial compatibility.

**Paragraph**: Industrial surfaces—from packaging to pipelines—require protective and functional coatings, but most current solutions are based on persistent, non-degradable polymers that contribute to environmental pollution. Autonomous AI-driven platforms can accelerate the discovery of biodegradable, protein- or polymer-based coatings with tailored functionalities, such as antimicrobial action, corrosion resistance, or self-cleaning properties. By integrating lifecycle analysis and environmental impact into the design loop, these new coatings can maintain or exceed current performance standards while ensuring rapid, safe degradation at end-of-life. This

**Approach**: provides a direct pathway to reducing industrial microplastic pollution and environmental hazards from coatings.

**Approach**: Use generative models and AI-guided design to propose biodegradable coating candidates with specific functional motifs. Implement robotic synthesis and high-throughput surface property testing (e.g., resistance to microbes, corrosion, fouling). Incorporate environmental fate and degradability assessment into the optimization loop, and test top candidates in real industrial environments.
