**Paragraph**: Bioelectronics and biophotonics require materials with highly specific, tunable, and integrable electronic or optical properties. AI-powered autonomous labs can design, synthesize, and characterize proteins or peptides with tailored charge transport, fluorescence, or light-absorption characteristics. By emphasizing device integration and scalability, these platforms can bridge the gap between molecular design and real-world applications, enabling innovative, environmentally friendly components for sensors, computing, energy harvesting, and advanced displays. AI-driven structure-function prediction and device-level simulation accelerate discovery and translation to industrial devices.
