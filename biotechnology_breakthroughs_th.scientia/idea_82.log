**Title**: Autonomous AI Engineering of Synthetic Microbial-Human Interfaces for Environmental Bioremediation

**Key Idea**: AI-powered autonomous systems can design and optimize engineered microbial communities that safely and effectively interface with human environments (e.g., urban, agricultural) for targeted bioremediation and pollution monitoring.

**Paragraph**: Traditional bioremediation technologies are limited by poor targeting, unpredictable community behavior, and lack of safe human-environment integration. AI-guided autonomous laboratories can engineer synthetic microbial consortia tailored to interface with human-impacted settings—such as urban waterways, agricultural soils, or industrial zones—providing targeted pollutant degradation, real-time monitoring, and minimal ecological disruption. By optimizing for safety, efficacy, and environmental compatibility, AI-designed microbial-human interfaces could revolutionize urban and agricultural pollution control, enabling responsive, adaptive, and minimally invasive environmental management.

**Approach**: Use AI-driven ecological and metabolic modeling to design consortia capable of degrading priority pollutants and interfacing with human environments. Employ automated adaptive evolution and high-throughput testing in human-relevant microcosms. Integrate biosensing modules for real-time pollutant detection and safety switches to prevent escape or unintended interactions.
