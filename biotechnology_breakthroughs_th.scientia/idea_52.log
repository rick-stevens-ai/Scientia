**Paragraph**: The growing demand for innovative biomaterials spans electronics, construction, consumer goods, and sustainable packaging. Autonomous AI laboratories can rapidly design, synthesize, and characterize new protein and polymer sequences, optimizing for elasticity, conductivity, self-healing, and biodegradability. By incorporating environmental impact, lifecycle analysis, and recyclability criteria directly into the discovery process, these systems can identify materials that are not only high-performing but also truly sustainableâ€”enabling next-generation materials that surpass conventional design limitations and address environmental challenges from the outset.
