**Title**: Autonomous AI-Guided Creation of Enzyme–Material Hybrids for Circular and Sustainable Biomanufacturing

**Key Idea**: AI-guided autonomous systems can create enzyme–material hybrid platforms—combining catalytic activity with advanced structural/material features—for next-generation circular biomanufacturing and sustainable process integration.

**Paragraph**: The fields of biocatalysis and material science remain largely separate, yet the integration of enzymes with functional materials (such as polymers or nanostructures) can yield hybrid platforms with synergistic properties—improving catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and reusability alongside mechanical strength, flexibility, or electronic/optical functionalities. AI-driven autonomous laboratories can design, synthesize, and screen vast libraries of enzyme–material hybrids, optimizing for circular manufacturing, recyclability, and performance in challenging industrial environments (e.g., biocatalytic recycling of plastics, self-healing materials, or bio-electronic interfaces). By uniting catalytic and material innovations, these hybrids could revolutionize sustainable manufacturing, enabling closed-loop processes and reducing environmental impact.

**Approach**: Combine AI-driven protein engineering with materials informatics to design enzyme–material hybrid candidates. Automate synthesis and high-throughput screening for both catalytic and material properties (e.g., mechanical strength, conductivity, recyclability). Use iterative AI optimization to balance function, scalability, and sustainability. Validate top candidates in pilot-scale circular manufacturing and recycling processes.
