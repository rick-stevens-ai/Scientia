**Paragraph**: While AI is increasingly used to optimize microbial consortia for production or waste valorization, a major opportunity exists in actively engineering communities for climate-positive outcomes—such as enhanced CO₂ fixation, methane mitigation, or upcycling of greenhouse gases into useful products. AI-guided, autonomous evolution platforms can design, assemble, and adapt microbial consortia under selective pressures that maximize carbon capture or greenhouse gas transformation, using real-time gas analytics, metabolic modeling, and iterative experimental feedback. This

**Approach**: could create robust, industrially relevant microbiomes that not only produce valuable chemicals but also directly contribute to reversing anthropogenic climate change.
