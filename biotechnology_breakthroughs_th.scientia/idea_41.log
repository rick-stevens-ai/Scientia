**Paragraph**: ** Bioelectronics and biophotonics require materials with highly specific and tunable electronic or optical properties. AI-powered autonomous labs can design, synthesize, and characterize proteins or peptides with tailored charge transport, fluorescence, or light-absorption characteristics, focusing on enhanced device integration, stability, and scalability. By leveraging AI to predict structure-function relationships and device performance in silico, these platforms can create innovative, environmentally friendly device components for sensors, computing, energy harvesting, and displays [Rogers 2021; Tabor 2022; Ghosh 2022].
