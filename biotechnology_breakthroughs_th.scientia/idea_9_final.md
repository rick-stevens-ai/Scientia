## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Autonomous AI Factories for Rapid Prototyping and Deployment of Modular Biosensors

**Key Idea**: AI-powered autonomous systems can accelerate the design, prototyping, and field deployment of modular biosensors for industrial and environmental monitoring.

**Paragraph**: Rapid, sensitive, and robust biosensors are essential for process optimization, quality control, and environmental compliance in industrial settings. However, traditional biosensor development is slow and often fails to adapt to new targets or changing environments. Autonomous AI laboratories can enable rapid, modular biosensor prototyping—combining synthetic biology, material science, and AI-driven optimization—to generate sensors responding to diverse analytes (chemicals, toxins, pathogens) with customizable detection ranges and environmental resilience. This paradigm can provide on-demand biosensor solutions for emerging industrial and environmental needs.

**Approach**: Use AI-guided combinatorial design of sensor modules (receptors, transducers, reporters) and automated assembly/testing workflows. Integrate machine learning for signal optimization and robustness under varying field conditions. Rapidly validate new sensors in real-world pilot deployments with feedback-driven improvement.
