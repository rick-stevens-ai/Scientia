**Approach**: Deploy an AI-driven robotic platform to design, synthesize, and screen enzyme variants using directed evolution and generative models. Integrate real-time multi-parametric data (activity, stability, substrate scope) with multi-objective optimization to balance catalytic efficiency and industrial robustness. Extend to include assessment of recyclability, process integration, and enzyme longevity under industrial conditions.
