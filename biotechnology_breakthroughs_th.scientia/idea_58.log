**Approach**: Use AI to model, design, and robotically assemble microbial consortia, implementing automated bioreactor experiments and adaptive laboratory evolution under industrially relevant conditions. Incorporate real-time multi-omics monitoring and ecological feedback to ensure community stability and optimal performance. Integrate predictive modeling to anticipate and mitigate ecological collapse or failure modes.
