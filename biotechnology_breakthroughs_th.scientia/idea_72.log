**Approach**: Use AI-driven metabolic and ecological modeling to design consortia with complementary functions (carbon fixation, gas conversion). Implement automated adaptive laboratory evolution and high-throughput bioreactor selection with real-time gas monitoring (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O fluxes). Integrate multi-omics and metabolic flux analysis for rapid community optimization, and validate in industrial pilot systems for net carbon-negative manufacturing.
