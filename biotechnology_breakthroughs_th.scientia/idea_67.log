**Paragraph**: Traditional biocatalysis and material science remain largely separate, yet the integration of enzymes with functional materials (such as polymers or nanostructures) can produce hybrid platforms with synergistic properties—improving catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and reusability while imparting mechanical strength, flexibility, or novel electronic/optical features. AI-driven autonomous labs can design, synthesize, and screen vast libraries of enzyme–material hybrids, optimizing them for process integration, recyclability, and performance in circular manufacturing contexts (e.g., biocatalytic recycling of plastics or self-healing materials). Such hybrids could revolutionize bio-based industries by uniting catalytic and material innovations for sustainability.
