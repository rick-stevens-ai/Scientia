**Paragraph**: ** Microbial communities can perform complex biotransformations that single strains cannot, but rationally designing effective consortia for industrial applications is challenging due to unpredictable interactions and environmental variability. AI-factories can automate the design, assembly, and adaptive optimization of synthetic microbial communities, using real-time multi-omics data and ecological modeling to enhance stability, productivity, and resilience. This enables efficient production of bio-based chemicals, plastics, fuels, and resource valorization from diverse waste streams, moving beyond traditional agriculture or health applications [Zomorrodi 2016; Carbonell 2019; Lawson 2019].
