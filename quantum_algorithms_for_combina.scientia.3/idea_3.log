**Paragraph**: Prime numbers play a crucial role in number theory, and their generation has numerous applications in cryptography and coding theory. Current classical algorithms for prime number generation, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, have limitations in terms of scalability. Quantum computing can potentially speed up this process by leveraging quantum parallelism [Shor 1994]. A quantum algorithm for prime number generation could enable faster and more efficient cryptographic protocols.
