**Paragraph**: Permutation polynomials are essential in number theory and have numerous applications in cryptography and coding theory. Current classical algorithms for computing permutation polynomials have limitations in terms of computational complexity. Quantum computing can potentially speed up this process by leveraging quantum parallelism [Lidl 1986]. A quantum algorithm for permutation polynomials could enable breakthroughs in cryptography and coding theory.
