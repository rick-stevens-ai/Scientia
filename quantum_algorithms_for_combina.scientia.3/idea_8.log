**Paragraph**: Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer coefficients and are a fundamental problem in number theory. Current classical algorithms for solving Diophantine equations have limitations in terms of computational complexity. Quantum computing can potentially speed up this process by leveraging quantum parallelism [Brakerski 2014]. A quantum algorithm for solving Diophantine equations could enable breakthroughs in cryptography and coding theory.
