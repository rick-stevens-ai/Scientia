**Paragraph**: The SVP is a fundamental problem in number theory and has numerous applications in cryptography and coding theory. Current classical algorithms for SVP have limitations in terms of computational complexity. Quantum computing can potentially speed up this process by leveraging quantum parallelism [Micciancio 2001]. A quantum algorithm for SVP could enable breakthroughs in cryptography and coding theory.
