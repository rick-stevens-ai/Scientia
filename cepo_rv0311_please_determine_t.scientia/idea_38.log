**Key Idea**: Targeting Rv0311 could provide a novel therapeutic strategy against M. tuberculosis infection.
-

**Paragraph**: Given Rv0311â€™s potential roles in cell wall integrity, stress response, and virulence, targeting this protein could disrupt M. tuberculosis survival and pathogenicity [Boucher 2009, Sassi 2017]. Inhibitors or antibodies targeting Rv0311 could be explored as therapeutic agents.
-

**Approach**: High-throughput screening for Rv0311 inhibitors, in vitro and in vivo efficacy studies.
