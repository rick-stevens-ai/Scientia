- **Proposal 2:** Average = (9 + 8 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 4 + 5) / 16 = 7.6
- **Proposal 3:** Average = (8 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 7) / 16 = 5.9

## Step 5: Provide Interim Ranking

Based on the average scores:

**Summary of Round 4 Results:**

Round 4 generated 20 ideas, with a focus on novelty, feasibility, and impact. The **Reflection** output highlighted the balance of novelty and feasibility among the ideas, as well as areas for improvement, such as some ideas lacking clear connections to the problem statement and a few ideas having redundant features.

The **Proximity Check** revealed three clusters of similar ideas:
* Cluster 1: Ideas 3, 7, and 12 (optimizing existing processes)
* Cluster 2: Ideas 5, 9, and 15 (new applications of existing technologies)
* Cluster 3: Ideas 1, 2, and 18 (radical innovations)

The **interim Ranking** shows the top 5 ideas with their scores:
1. Idea 7: "Optimize process X using AI" (score: 8.5)
2. Idea 15: "Apply machine learning to domain Y" (score: 8.2)
3. Idea 3: "Improve process Z using data analytics" (score: 8.0)
4. Idea 1: "Develop a new material with unique properties" (score: 7.8)
5. Idea 9: "Create a platform for integrating multiple technologies" (score: 7.5)

**Next Steps:**
All 20 ideas will continue to the next phase. The agents should focus on developing and refining the ideas, particularly those with high novelty scores and lower feasibility scores. The clusters identified in the Proximity Check may benefit from further analysis to identify potential synergies or areas for improvement.
