**Key Idea**: Rv0311 modulates host cell autophagy by interacting with host proteins like LC3 and ATG5 to enhance M. tuberculosis survival within host cells.
-

**Paragraph**: Autophagy is a critical host defense mechanism [Tiwari 2017]. M. tuberculosis can manipulate autophagy to survive within host cells [Kim 2019]. Rv0311 could potentially interact with host proteins like LC3 and ATG5 to modulate autophagy.
-

**Approach**: Autophagy assays in infected host cells, co-IP with host autophagy-related proteins.
