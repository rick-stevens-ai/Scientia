**Key Idea**: Rv0311 interacts with cell wall biosynthesis proteins to modulate M. tuberculosis cell wall integrity.
- **Refined

**Paragraph**: The cell wall of M. tuberculosis is crucial for survival [Boucher 2009]. Rv0311's genomic context and protein sequence homology suggest a role in cell wall biosynthesis, potentially interacting with proteins like Rv0008 and Rv0934 [Ravigne 2004, Drancourt 2013]. Studies have shown that cell wall biosynthesis proteins are essential for bacterial survival and pathogenicity [Ravigne 2004, Sassi 2017].
- **Refined

**Approach**: Co-IP with cell wall proteins, cell wall integrity assays under stress conditions.
