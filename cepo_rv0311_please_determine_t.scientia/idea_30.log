**Key Idea**: Rv0311 regulates stress-response genes to enhance survival under hostile conditions.
-

**Paragraph**: Stress response is vital for M. tuberculosis survival [Dona 2013]. Rv0311 potentially regulates genes involved in heat shock, oxidative stress, and nutrient starvation responses [Sassi 2017, Tiwari 2017]. The ability of M. tuberculosis to adapt to stressful environments is critical for its pathogenicity.
-

**Approach**: Gene expression assays under stress conditions, survival assays under hostile conditions.
