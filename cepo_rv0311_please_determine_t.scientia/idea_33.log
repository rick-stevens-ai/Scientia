**Key Idea**: Rv0311 interacts with specific cell wall biosynthesis proteins (e.g., Rv0008 and Rv0934) to modulate M. tuberculosis cell wall integrity under stress conditions.
-

**Paragraph**: The cell wall of M. tuberculosis is crucial for survival [Boucher 2009]. Rv0311's genomic context and protein sequence homology suggest a role in cell wall biosynthesis, potentially interacting with proteins like Rv0008 and Rv0934 [Ravigne 2004, Drancourt 2013]. These interactions are essential for bacterial survival and pathogenicity [Ravigne 2004, Sassi 2017].
-

**Approach**: Co-IP with cell wall proteins under stress conditions, cell wall integrity assays under stress conditions.
