**Title**: ** Quantum Kernel Methods for Enhanced Pattern Recognition in High-Dimensional Data

**Key Idea**: ** Quantum computers can implement kernel methods that efficiently capture non-linear relationships in high-dimensional data, providing exponential speedup over classical approaches for certain classes of problems.

**Paragraph**: ** Kernel methods are central to many machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines, where the implicit mapping of data into higher-dimensional spaces enables detection of complex patterns. However, classical computation of certain kernels becomes intractable as data dimensionality increases. Quantum computers can exploit the Hilbert space structure of quantum states to evaluate complex kernels with polynomial or even exponential speedup, enabling the representation and learning of intricate decision boundaries that are inaccessible to classical machines [Schuld 2019]. This

**Approach**: es for certain classes of problems.  
**Paragraph:** Kernel methods are central to many machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines, where the implicit mapping of data into higher-dimensional spaces enables detection of complex patterns. However, classical computation of certain kernels becomes intractable as data dimensionality increases. Quantum computers can exploit the Hilbert space structure of quantum states to evaluate complex kernels with polynomial or even exponential speedup, enabling the representation and learning of intricate decision boundaries that are inaccessible to classical machines [Schuld 2019]. This approach is particularly promising for tasks like image or genomic data analysis, where high dimensionality is a bottleneck. By leveraging quantum kernel estimation, machine learning models may achieve superior accuracy and generalization on datasets that are currently challenging for classical methods [Havlíček 2019].  
**Approach:** Develop quantum circuits to encode classical data into quantum states and estimate the overlap (kernel) between states using the swap test or related protocols. Compare the performance of quantum kernel-based classifiers with classical SVMs on benchmark datasets with varying dimensionality. Analyze scalability, accuracy, and resource requirements through both simulation and experiments on existing quantum hardware.
