## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Harnessing Crop Wild Relatives’ Microbiomes for Novel Drought-Resilient Microbial Traits and Synthetic Community Design

**Key Idea**: Systematic mining and functional characterization of microbiomes from drought-adapted crop wild relatives (CWRs) can uncover novel microbial taxa and drought-resilient traits for use in synthetic community design and crop improvement.

**Paragraph**: Crop wild relatives thrive in extreme environments and harbor unique microbiomes with specialized drought adaptation strategies not present in domesticated crops [Rodríguez 2021]. By systematically characterizing and transferring beneficial microbiota or their traits (e.g., novel osmolyte pathways, uncommon stress effectors) from CWRs, this

**Approach**: expands the available toolbox for synthetic drought-resilient communities, potentially overcoming current limitations in microbiome engineering [Wasson 2019, Escudero-Martinez 2022]. This strategy also leverages natural co-evolution, reducing the risk of maladaptive or unstable field outcomes.

**Approach**: Collect rhizosphere and endosphere samples from drought-adapted CWRs; perform metagenomics and functional screening for novel stress traits; test microbial isolates or gene cassettes in synthetic communities and field trials with domesticated crops; monitor plant health and drought resilience.

**Key References**: [Rodríguez 2021, "Harnessing Crop Wild Relatives"], [Wasson 2019], [Escudero-Martinez 2022, "Wild Plant Microbiomes in Crop Improvement"]

**Differentiation**: Unlike previous ideas, this approach directly leverages the unexplored functional diversity of wild plant microbiomes, adding new genetic and ecological resources to existing synthetic designs.
