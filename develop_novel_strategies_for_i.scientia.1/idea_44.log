**Title**: CRISPR-Guided Root Exudate Engineering for Precision and Dynamic Microbiome Recruitment

**Key Idea**: CRISPR/Cas-mediated multiplex and inducible editing of root exudate biosynthesis genes enables dynamic, tailored recruitment of diverse beneficial microbes for drought adaptation.

**Paragraph**: Multiplex and inducible genome editing of root exudate pathways allows for simultaneous, flexible manipulation of multiple metabolite classes, facilitating recruitment of a broader and more adaptive spectrum of beneficial microbes [Sasse 2018, Bulgarelli 2013]. By adding conditional (e.g., drought-inducible) promoters, root exudate profiles can be dynamically adjusted in response to environmental cues, further increasing precision and ecological relevance [Zhalnina 2018, Dombrowski 2017]. Integration with computational exudate-microbe interaction models makes outcomes more predictable and adaptable to changing field conditions.

**Approach**: Use multiplex CRISPR/Cas editing, including inducible promoters, to engineer exudate biosynthesis genes; apply computational models to predict and optimize microbiome shifts; validate in greenhouse and multi-site field trials, monitoring both exudate profiles and microbiome dynamics.

**Key References**: [Sasse 2018], [Bulgarelli 2013], [Zhalnina 2018], [Dombrowski 2017, "Root Exudates and Their Impact on Soil Microbiomes"]

**Modifications**: Incorporated inducible editing for dynamic control, and highlighted integration with computational modeling; added [Dombrowski 2017] for inducible root exudate regulation.
