## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Targeted Manipulation of Plant-Microbe-Soil Feedback Loops for Self-Reinforcing Drought Resilience in Rotational Cropping Systems

**Key Idea**: Intentional engineering of positive plant-microbe-soil feedback loops (PMFs) within rotational cropping systems can create self-reinforcing, persistent improvements in soil health and crop drought resilience across seasons.

**Paragraph**: PMFs, where beneficial microbes and crops mutually shape soil properties for lasting resilience, are underutilized in microbiome engineering [Bever 2010]. By designing rotation sequences and microbial amendments that reinforce beneficial feedbacks (e.g., increased organic matter, stable microbial networks, reduced pathogen loads), it is possible to achieve compounding gains in drought adaptation and yield stability over time [Hu 2018, Veen 2019]. This concept integrates microbiome engineering with sustainable agronomy, ensuring that drought resilience is not just a one-off effect but accumulates over seasons.

**Approach**: Design rotational cropping sequences with targeted microbial amendments; monitor soil properties, microbial network structure, and plant performance over multiple years; use ecological modeling to optimize feedback strength and persistence.

**Key References**: [Bever 2010, "Plant-Soil Feedbacks"], [Hu 2018], [Veen 2019, "Soil Microbiome Feedbacks and Crop Resilience"]

**Differentiation**: This idea uniquely exploits temporal dynamics and feedbacks in rotation systems to engineer lasting, cumulative drought resilience—a strategy not covered by any previous ideas.
