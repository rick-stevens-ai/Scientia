**Title**: Microbial-Triggered Aquaporin Networks for Enhanced Crop Water Uptake During Drought

**Key Idea**: Select or engineer microbes that orchestrate the upregulation of diverse aquaporin gene networks to maximize water transport and drought tolerance in crops.

**Paragraph**: Some microbes can coordinately upregulate multiple aquaporin isoforms, boosting water uptake efficiency more effectively than targeting single genes [Marulanda 2010, Rolli 2015, Lata 2019]. This network-level modulation offers robust drought protection.

**Approach**: Identify/engineer microbes that activate broad aquaporin gene families; inoculate crops; assess network activation, water usage, and yield under drought.

**Key References**: [Marulanda 2010], [Rolli 2015], [Lata 2019, "Aquaporin Gene Families and Drought Tolerance"]

**Modifications**: Shifted to focus on network-level aquaporin activation. Added [Lata 2019].
