**Title**: Designer Microbial Metabolite Cocktails as Biostimulants for Broad-Spectrum Drought Tolerance

**Key Idea**: Application of defined mixtures of microbial metabolites (e.g., lipopeptides, polysaccharides, phytohormones) can synergistically stimulate multiple drought defense pathways in crops.

**Paragraph**: Rather than single metabolites, defined cocktails can activate different plant defense pathways for more comprehensive drought protection [Saikia 2018, Ola 2021, Calvo 2014]. These biostimulants are scalable and can be tailored for different crop needs.

**Approach**: Isolate and formulate metabolite cocktails; test on various crops under drought; use transcriptomics to assess pathway activation and yield outcomes.

**Key References**: [Saikia 2018], [Ola 2021], [Calvo 2014, "Plant Biostimulants: Definition, Concept, Main Categories"]

**Modifications**: Extended from single metabolites to defined cocktails for broader efficacy. Added [Calvo 2014].
