**Title**: Microbiome-Driven Priming and Epigenetic Drought Memory in Crops

**Key Idea**: Beneficial microbes can induce epigenetic modifications that prime crops for enhanced and heritable drought memory.

**Paragraph**: Microbial priming not only induces physiological memory but can also trigger epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation) in plants, leading to longer-lasting and potentially transgenerational drought resilience [Conrath 2006, De Kesel 2021, Lämke 2017]. This

**Approach**: leverages both biochemical and heritable mechanisms for robust stress adaptation.

**Approach**: Inoculate crops with priming microbes; expose to drought; analyze physiological and epigenetic markers; test persistence and heritability of drought memory in subsequent generations.

**Key References**: [Conrath 2006], [De Kesel 2021], [Lämke 2017, "Epigenetic Mechanisms of Drought Memory in Plants"]

**Modifications**: Integrated epigenetic dimension and potential heritability, strengthening the claim. Added [Lämke 2017].
