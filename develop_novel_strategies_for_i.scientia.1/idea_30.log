**Title**: Designer Microbial VOCs for Precision Priming of Crop Stress Pathways

**Key Idea**: Engineering microbes to emit custom blends of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) enables targeted priming of plant drought and stress responses.

**Paragraph**: Advances in synthetic biology enable engineering of microbial strains to emit specific VOC profiles tailored to activate desired plant defense pathways [Bitas 2013, Zhang 2019, Tyc 2017]. This precision

**Approach**: can be tuned for different crop species and stress scenarios.

**Approach**: Engineer microbial strains for custom VOC production; apply to crops; use transcriptomics to assess pathway activation and drought outcomes.

**Key References**: [Bitas 2013], [Zhang 2019], [Tyc 2017, "Volatile Organic Compounds in Microbeâ€“Plant Interactions"]

**Modifications**: Added synthetic biology for custom VOC profiles; included [Tyc 2017].
