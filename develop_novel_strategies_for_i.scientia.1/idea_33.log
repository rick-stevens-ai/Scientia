**Title**: Holistic Microbiome-Based Bioremediation for Combined Drought and Salinity Stress in Crops

**Key Idea**: Engineered microbial consortia with both salt and drought tolerance traits can simultaneously alleviate salinity and water deficit stress, boosting crop yield.

**Paragraph**: Many drought-prone regions face both salinity and water deficits; combining salt-tolerant and drought-adaptive PGPR in consortia addresses both challenges, improving plant health and yield synergistically [Egamberdieva 2019, Shrivastava 2015, Paul 2021]. This integrated strategy is essential for real-world resilience.

**Approach**: Isolate/engineer consortia with complementary salt and drought tolerance traits; validate in saline, drought-affected field soils; monitor plant and soil health.

**Key References**: [Egamberdieva 2019], [Shrivastava 2015], [Paul 2021, "Integrated Management of Salinity and Drought"]

**Modifications**: Extended from individual strains to consortia for combined stress; added [Paul 2021].
