**Title**: Broad-Spectrum Microbial Quorum Quenching Consortia for Targeted Pathogen Suppression in Drought-Stressed Crops

**Key Idea**: Engineered or selected microbial consortia capable of degrading diverse quorum sensing signals and forming stable rhizosphere communities provide broad-spectrum and durable pathogen suppression under drought.

**Paragraph**: Pathogen communities use a variety of quorum signals; consortia with multiple, complementary quorum quenching enzymes, coupled with strong rhizosphere persistence, suppress a broad range of pathogens and reduce disease outbreaks exacerbated by drought [Sharma 2020, Venturi 2016, Grandclément 2016, Dong 2019]. This

**Approach**: provides both breadth and durability of disease suppression.

**Approach**: Engineer/select consortia with diverse quorum quenching enzymes and persistence traits; apply to crops; longitudinally monitor pathogen loads, plant health, and yield under drought.

**Key References**: [Sharma 2020], [Venturi 2016], [Grandclément 2016], [Dong 2019, "Quorum Quenching for Crop Protection"]

**Modifications**: Emphasized rhizosphere persistence and cited [Dong 2019].
