# Final Report: Idea 12

## Final ELO Score: 1505.1

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Microbiome-Directed, Precision Engineering of Root System Architecture for Enhanced Drought Foraging, Resource Use, and Carbon Efficiency

**Key Idea**: Harnessing and engineering microbes that modulate specific root traits (depth, branching, angle, plasticity) and root exudate-mediated carbon efficiency enables crops to maximize water and nutrient acquisition under drought.

**Paragraph**: Adding root exudate-mediated carbon efficiency—via microbiome control—can further optimize belowground resource allocation and reduce unnecessary carbon expenditure, supporting both drought and climate resilience [Preece 2019]. This enables crop- and environment-specific solutions with improved use efficiency [Finkel 2017, Glick 2012, Lynch 2019, Atkinson 2019].

**Approach**: Identify/engineer microbes for root architecture and exudate modulation; test in crops using high-throughput phenotyping and carbon allocation analysis under drought.

**Key References**: [Finkel 2017], [Glick 2012], [Lynch 2019], [Atkinson 2019], [Preece 2019, "Root Exudates and Carbon Economy"]

**Modifications**: Added root exudate/carbon efficiency traits, supported by [Preece 2019].
