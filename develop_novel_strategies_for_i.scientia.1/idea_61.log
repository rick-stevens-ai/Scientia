**Title**: Microbial-Triggered Aquaporin Network Activation for Enhanced Crop Water Uptake and Drought Resilience

**Key Idea**: Select or engineer microbes that coordinately upregulate multiple aquaporin gene networks, maximizing plant water transport efficiency and drought tolerance.

**Paragraph**: Some microbes can orchestrate the upregulation of entire aquaporin gene families, not just single isoforms, enhancing water uptake and translocation more effectively [Marulanda 2010, Rolli 2015, Lata 2019, Moshelion 2022]. This network-level modulation offers robust, adaptable drought protection and may also improve water use efficiency under fluctuating conditions.

**Approach**: Identify/engineer microbes that activate broad aquaporin gene networks; inoculate crops; assess gene network activation, water usage, and yield under drought using transcriptomics and physiological assays.

**Key References**: [Marulanda 2010], [Rolli 2015], [Lata 2019], [Moshelion 2022, "Aquaporins and Plant Water Use Efficiency"]

**Modifications**: Added impact on water use efficiency and cited [Moshelion 2022].
