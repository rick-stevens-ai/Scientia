**Title**: Microbiome-Induced Epigenetic Priming, Heritable Drought Memory, and Accelerated Adaptation in Crop Plants

**Key Idea**: Beneficial microbes induce specific, heritable epigenetic modifications that prime crops for rapid, persistent, and transgenerational drought resilience and adaptation.

**Paragraph**: Beyond heritable DNA methylation and histone modifications, microbiome-induced small RNAs (sRNAs) are now recognized as agents of drought memory and stress adaptation [Zhang 2013]. By targeting both canonical (methylation/histone) and non-canonical (sRNA) epigenetic pathways, microbial priming may accelerate adaptive evolution in crops facing recurring drought [Conrath 2006, De Kesel 2021, Lämke 2017, Crisp 2016]. This

**Approach**: could be selectively bred or engineered for cumulative field benefit.

**Approach**: Inoculate crops with priming microbes; induce drought; analyze sRNA, DNA methylation, and histone modification profiles; follow multiple plant generations for persistence and phenotypic adaptation.

**Key References**: [Conrath 2006], [De Kesel 2021], [Lämke 2017], [Crisp 2016], [Zhang 2013, "sRNA-Mediated Epigenetic Inheritance"]

**Modifications**: Added the role of sRNAs in epigenetic priming, with [Zhang 2013] as new support.
