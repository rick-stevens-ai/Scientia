## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Microbial Modulation of Plant Multi-Hormone Networks and Cross-Talk for Precision Drought Yield Optimization

**Key Idea**: Engineering soil microbes to modulate interconnected plant hormone networks and their cross-talk (ABA, cytokinins, auxins, gibberellins, ethylene, jasmonates) enables highly precise, context-dependent control of growth, stress response, and yield during drought.

**Paragraph**: Expanding beyond five classic hormones, recent research highlights the importance of hormone cross-talk, including jasmonates and salicylic acid, in fine-tuning drought trade-offs [Peleg 2011]. Microbial modulation of these networks, and their interactions, can better optimize resource allocation, stress adaptation, and productivity across crop stages and stress intensities [Ngumbi 2016, Vacheron 2013, Meena 2017, Spaepen 2014].

**Approach**: Engineer microbes for multi-hormone and cross-talk modulation; validate impacts via hormone profiling, multi-omics, and phenotyping; test performance and yield stability under field drought.

**Key References**: [Ngumbi 2016], [Vacheron 2013], [Meena 2017], [Spaepen 2014], [Peleg 2011, "Hormone Cross-Talk in Drought Tolerance"]

**Modifications**: Included hormone cross-talk (jasmonates, salicylic acid), citing [Peleg 2011].
