**Title**: Next-Generation Nitrogen-Fixing Endophytes for Cereals: Multi-Stress and Field-Stable Engineering

**Key Idea**: Genetically engineered endophytes with enhanced nitrogen fixation and stress adaptation traits can sustainably boost non-legume crop yield in drought-prone environments.

**Paragraph**: To address both nitrogen limitation and stress resilience, endophytes can be engineered for robust nitrogenase activity, colonization, and additional stress-mitigating traits (e.g., osmolyte secretion) [Bloch 2020, Mus 2016, Haskett 2021]. Field stability and biosafety are prioritized with containment systems.

**Approach**: Engineer endophytes for nitrogen fixation and stress tolerance; test colonization, persistence, and yield impacts under field drought; implement gene containment strategies.

**Key References**: [Bloch 2020], [Mus 2016], [Haskett 2021, "Engineering Endophytes for Sustainable Agriculture"]

**Modifications**: Added multi-stress traits and biosafety/field-stability focus. Added [Haskett 2021].
