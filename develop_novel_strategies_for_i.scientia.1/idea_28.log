**Title**: Targeted Phage-Microbiome Therapy to Suppress Pathogens and Foster Beneficials During Drought

**Key Idea**: Precision application of bacteriophages, combined with microbial community engineering, selectively reduces drought-exacerbated pathogens while promoting beneficial microbiota.

**Paragraph**: Integrating phage therapy with beneficial microbe introduction can shift soil microbiomes toward resilience, counteracting drought-induced pathogen blooms without harming beneficials [Morella 2018, Kuzyakov 2021, Wang 2021]. Monitoring community shifts post-phage application ensures ecosystem health.

**Approach**: Identify key pathogens and their phages; co-inoculate with beneficial microbes; track microbiome composition, plant health, and yield post-application.

**Key References**: [Morella 2018], [Kuzyakov 2021], [Wang 2021, "Phage-Mediated Microbiome Engineering"]

**Modifications**: Combined phage therapy with beneficial introduction, and emphasized ecosystem monitoring. Added [Wang 2021].
