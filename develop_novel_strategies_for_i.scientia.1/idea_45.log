**Title**: Multi-Functional Endophytes Co-Delivering Osmoprotectants, Antioxidants, and Phytohormones for Comprehensive Crop Drought Resilience

**Key Idea**: Engineering endophytic bacteria to co-produce plant-compatible osmoprotectants, antioxidant enzymes, and phytohormone modulators synergistically enhances crop drought tolerance and recovery.

**Paragraph**: Beyond osmolyte overproduction (proline, trehalose), endophytes can be engineered to also secrete antioxidant enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase) and modulate phytohormones (e.g., auxins, abscisic acid), thus providing layered protection against osmotic, oxidative, and hormonal stress during drought [Yang 2009, Vurukonda 2016, Ali 2014, Meena 2017]. This multi-functionality broadens adaptability, increases efficacy, and may also facilitate recovery post-drought.

**Approach**: Engineer endophytes for co-production of osmoprotectants, antioxidants, and phytohormone modulators; inoculate crops; monitor physiological, molecular, and yield outcomes pre-, during, and post-drought.

**Key References**: [Yang 2009], [Vurukonda 2016], [Ali 2014], [Meena 2017]

**Modifications**: Added phytohormone modulation to osmolyte and antioxidant production for a more holistic approach; cited [Meena 2017] for hormone modulation.
