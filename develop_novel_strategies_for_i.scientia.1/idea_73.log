**Title**: High-Throughput Screening and Synthetic Assembly of Functionally and Genetically Diverse Mycorrhizal Consortia for Drought-Adapted and Disease-Resistant Crops

**Key Idea**: High-throughput AMF strain selection and rational assembly of functionally and genetically diverse consortia create robust mycorrhizal partnerships that boost drought resilience and suppress soil-borne diseases.

**Paragraph**: Incorporating genetic diversity—alongside functional diversity—reduces susceptibility to emerging pathogens and enhances adaptability to novel field stresses [Van der Heijden 2015]. Disease suppression adds a further layer of resilience in drought-prone environments [Augé 2001, Smith 2010, van der Heijden 2015, Sikes 2010].

**Approach**: Screen/assemble AMF consortia for functional and genetic diversity; validate in multi-year, multi-environment field trials for colonization, persistence, drought resilience, and disease suppression.

**Key References**: [Augé 2001], [Smith 2010], [van der Heijden 2015], [Sikes 2010], [Van der Heijden 2015, "Genetic Diversity in Mycorrhizal Fungi"]

**Modifications**: Added genetic diversity and disease suppression, supported by [Van der Heijden 2015].
