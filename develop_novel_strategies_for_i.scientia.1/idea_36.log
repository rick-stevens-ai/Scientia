**Title**: Siderophore-Producing Microbial Consortia for Iron Mobilization and Drought Resilience

**Key Idea**: Multi-strain consortia of siderophore-producing microbes can synergistically mobilize iron and support plant nutrition under drought.

**Paragraph**: Drought-induced iron deficiency can be more effectively addressed by consortia of siderophore-producers with complementary iron-mobilization mechanisms, increasing robustness and breadth of nutrient support [Rajkumar 2010, Dimkpa 2016, Sharma 2020]. This consortium

**Approach**: also buffers against environmental variability.

**Approach**: Assemble consortia of siderophore-producing microbes with diverse mechanisms; inoculate crops; monitor iron status, growth, and yield in droughted soils.

**Key References**: [Rajkumar 2010], [Dimkpa 2016], [Sharma 2020, "Microbial Consortia for Soil Nutrient Management"]

**Modifications**: Shifted from single strains to consortia for robustness. Added [Sharma 2020].
