**Title**: Synthetic Multi-Functional Endophytes Co-Delivering Osmoprotectants, Antioxidants, Phytohormones, and Stress-Responsive Peptides for Comprehensive Crop Drought Resilience

**Key Idea**: Engineered endophytes co-producing osmoprotectants, antioxidant enzymes, phytohormone modulators, and stress-responsive peptides synergistically enhance drought tolerance, recovery, and systemic plant protection.

**Paragraph**: While co-production of osmolytes, antioxidants, and phytohormones broadens drought protection, the addition of stress-responsive peptides (e.g., defensins, dehydrins) can further improve plant resilience and recovery by activating rapid cellular protection mechanisms [Grover 2012]. This comprehensive suite of functions provides both immediate and sustained drought adaptation, potentially reducing the need for chemical inputs [Yang 2009, Vurukonda 2016, Ali 2014, Meena 2017].

**Approach**: Engineer endophytes for production of osmoprotectants, antioxidants, phytohormone modulators, and stress-responsive peptides; apply to crops; assess multi-level plant responses and recovery through omics and physiological measurements.

**Key References**: [Yang 2009], [Vurukonda 2016], [Ali 2014], [Meena 2017], [Grover 2012, "Plant Stress Response Peptides"]

**Modifications**: Added stress-responsive peptides for rapid plant protection, supported by [Grover 2012].
