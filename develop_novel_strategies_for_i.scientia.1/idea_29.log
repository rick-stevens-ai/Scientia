**Title**: High-Throughput Selection and Synthetic Communities of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi for Drought-Adapted Crops

**Key Idea**: Combining high-throughput AMF strain selection with synthetic consortia design creates robust mycorrhizal partnerships for drought resilience and yield.

**Paragraph**: While high-throughput selection identifies superior AMF strains, assembling synthetic communities of functionally diverse AMF can provide broader resilience and adaptability to variable field conditions [Augé 2001, Smith 2010, van der Heijden 2015]. This

**Approach**: mimics natural diversity for greater efficacy.

**Approach**: Screen AMF for drought adaptation; design consortia with complementary functions; test on crops in multi-site trials; monitor colonization and plant performance.

**Key References**: [Augé 2001], [Smith 2010], [van der Heijden 2015, "Mycorrhizal Ecology and Diversity"]

**Modifications**: Added synthetic consortia design for functional diversity. Added [van der Heijden 2015].
