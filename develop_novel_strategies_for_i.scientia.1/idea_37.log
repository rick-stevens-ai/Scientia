**Title**: Microbial Quorum Quenching Consortia for Targeted Pathogen Suppression in Drought-Stressed Crops

**Key Idea**: Engineered or selected microbial consortia capable of degrading diverse quorum sensing signals provide broad-spectrum pathogen suppression under drought.

**Paragraph**: Pathogen communities use varied quorum signals; consortia with multiple quorum quenching activities can suppress a broader range of pathogens, reducing disease outbreaks exacerbated by drought [Sharma 2020, Venturi 2016, Grandclément 2016]. This broad-spectrum

**Approach**: enhances yield protection.

**Approach**: Engineer/select consortia with diverse quorum quenching enzymes; apply to crops; monitor pathogen loads, plant health, and yield under drought.

**Key References**: [Sharma 2020], [Venturi 2016], [Grandclément 2016, "Quorum Quenching in Plant-Associated Microbiomes"]

**Modifications**: Broadened to consortia for diverse signal targeting. Added [Grandclément 2016].
