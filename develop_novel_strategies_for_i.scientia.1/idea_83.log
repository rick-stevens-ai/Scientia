**Title**: Microbial-Triggered Broad Aquaporin Network Activation and Root Hydraulic Adjustment for Enhanced Crop Water Uptake and Drought Resilience

**Key Idea**: Select or engineer microbes that coordinately upregulate multiple aquaporin gene networks and root hydraulic traits, maximizing plant water transport efficiency and drought tolerance.

**Paragraph**: Targeting both aquaporin gene networks and root hydraulic adjustment (e.g., root pressure, permeability) can further improve water uptake and efficiency under fluctuating drought [Maurel 2015]. This network-level and physiological modulation offers robust, adaptable drought protection [Marulanda 2010, Rolli 2015, Lata 2019, Moshelion 2022].

**Approach**: Identify/engineer microbes that activate aquaporin networks and adjust root hydraulics; evaluate gene activation, physiology, and yield under drought.

**Key References**: [Marulanda 2010], [Rolli 2015], [Lata 2019], [Moshelion 2022], [Maurel 2015, "Root Hydraulic Conductivity and Aquaporin Regulation"]

**Modifications**: Added root hydraulic adjustment, citing [Maurel 2015].
