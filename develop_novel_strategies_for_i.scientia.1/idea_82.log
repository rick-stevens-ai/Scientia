**Title**: Designer Microbial Metabolite Cocktails as Scalable, Multi-Pathway Biostimulants for Drought Protection and Yield Enhancement in Crops

**Key Idea**: Application of defined, scalable mixtures of microbial metabolites (lipopeptides, polysaccharides, phytohormones, signaling molecules) synergistically activates multiple drought defense pathways and improves yield in crops.

**Paragraph**: Including signaling molecules (e.g., N-acyl-homoserine lactones) as part of the cocktail can further coordinate plant and microbiome responses, amplifying systemic protection [Schikora 2016]. These biostimulants are scalable, tunable, and compatible with diverse agronomic systems [Saikia 2018, Ola 2021, Calvo 2014, Colla 2017].

**Approach**: Formulate cocktails with defense and signaling metabolites; apply to multiple crops under drought; use omics to assess multi-pathway activation and yield.

**Key References**: [Saikia 2018], [Ola 2021], [Calvo 2014], [Colla 2017], [Schikora 2016]

**Modifications**: Added signaling molecules for coordinated responses, citing [Schikora 2016].
