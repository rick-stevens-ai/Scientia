**Title**: Advanced Seed Coating Technologies Embedding Multi-Strain Microbial Consortia and Smart, Environmentally Responsive Matrices for Drought-Prone and Marginal Soils

**Key Idea**: Precision seed coatings embedding drought-adaptive microbial consortia within smart, environmentally responsive polymers or hydrogels ensure reliable establishment and persistence of beneficial microbiomes across variable and marginal field stress conditions.

**Paragraph**: Incorporation of environmental sensors (e.g., pH, temperature, or nutrient-responsive hydrogel release) into coatings extends applicability to marginal soils and enables smarter, context-aware microbial delivery [Zhang 2022]. This

**Approach**: further improves operational scalability and field consistency [Bashan 2014, Malusá 2016, Barros-Rodríguez 2022, Vassilev 2020].

**Approach**: Develop coatings with multi-sensor responsive matrices and microbial consortia; conduct multi-soil, multi-year field trials; assess establishment, persistence, and crop performance.

**Key References**: [Bashan 2014], [Malusá 2016], [Barros-Rodríguez 2022], [Vassilev 2020], [Zhang 2022, "Smart Seed Coating Technologies"]

**Modifications**: Added multi-environment sensors for marginal soils, citing [Zhang 2022].
