**Title**: Synthetic Biology-Enabled Designer Microbial VOCs for Crop-Specific and Stress-Responsive Priming of Drought Adaptation Pathways

**Key Idea**: Engineering microbes to emit crop-specific and stress-responsive blends of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) enables targeted and adaptive priming of plant defense and drought response pathways.

**Paragraph**: Synthetic biology allows precision engineering of microbial VOC emission profiles tailored to specific crops and stress scenarios, leveraging both constitutive and inducible VOCs for dynamic priming of plant responses [Bitas 2013, Zhang 2019, Tyc 2017, Sharifi 2018]. This

**Approach**: can be tuned for maximum efficacy and minimal off-target effects across diverse crop and climate contexts.

**Approach**: Engineer microbial strains for crop- and stress-specific VOC production, including inducible VOCs; apply to crops; use transcriptomics and phenotyping to assess pathway activation, drought tolerance, and non-target impacts.

**Key References**: [Bitas 2013], [Zhang 2019], [Tyc 2017], [Sharifi 2018, "Microbial VOCs and Plant Abiotic Stress"]

**Modifications**: Added crop-specific and inducible VOCs; cited [Sharifi 2018] for stress-responsive VOCs.
