# Final Report: Idea 13

## Final ELO Score: 1514.5

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Engineered Microbial Consortia for Simultaneous Drought, Salinity, and Heavy Metal Stress Alleviation in Crops

**Key Idea**: Rationally designed microbial consortia with combined drought, salinity, and heavy metal tolerance traits synergistically enhance crop resilience and yield in degraded, multi-stress soils.

**Paragraph**: Many drought-prone regions also face heavy metal contamination; consortia combining drought, salt, and heavy metal tolerance (e.g., metallothionein production) address triple stress scenarios and broaden field applicability [Zhuang 2021]. This

**Approach**: further stabilizes ion homeostasis and plant health under extreme conditions [Egamberdieva 2019, Shrivastava 2015, Paul 2021, Numan 2018].

**Approach**: Isolate/engineer consortia with multi-stress tolerance and metabolic complementarity; validate in multi-year, degraded field soils; monitor plant/soil health and yield.

**Key References**: [Egamberdieva 2019], [Shrivastava 2015], [Paul 2021], [Numan 2018], [Zhuang 2021, "Microbial Remediation of Heavy Metal Stresses"]

**Modifications**: Added heavy metal tolerance for broader stress coverage, citing [Zhuang 2021].
