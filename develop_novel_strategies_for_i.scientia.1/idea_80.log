**Title**: Multi-Mechanism, Persistent Siderophore-Producing Microbial Consortia for Enhanced Iron Mobilization, Nutrient Cycling, and Drought Resilience in Crops

**Key Idea**: Multi-strain consortia of siderophore-producing microbes with diverse iron-mobilizing mechanisms, persistent colonization, and co-beneficial nutrient cycling traits synergistically improve plant nutrition and drought resilience.

**Paragraph**: Adding co-beneficial nutrient cycling—such as phosphate solubilization or potassium mobilization—amplifies the impact of iron mobilization on overall plant nutrition and drought resilience [Shen 2020]. Persistent colonization ensures long-term benefit across different soils [Rajkumar 2010, Dimkpa 2016, Sharma 2020, Ahmed 2014].

**Approach**: Assemble consortia with complementary siderophore and nutrient cycling traits; monitor persistence, iron/nutrient uptake, and plant performance under drought.

**Key References**: [Rajkumar 2010], [Dimkpa 2016], [Sharma 2020], [Ahmed 2014], [Shen 2020, "Microbial Co-Benefits in Nutrient Cycling"]

**Modifications**: Added co-beneficial nutrient cycling traits, citing [Shen 2020].
