**Title**: Integrated Phage-Microbiome Therapy for Selective Pathogen Suppression and Beneficial Microbiota Promotion During Drought

**Key Idea**: Precision application of bacteriophages, coupled with microbial community engineering and ecological monitoring, selectively reduces drought-exacerbated pathogens while fostering beneficial microbiota and soil health.

**Paragraph**: Integrating targeted phage therapy with beneficial microbe co-inoculation and ecological monitoring enables selective suppression of drought-induced pathogen blooms without collateral damage to beneficials [Morella 2018, Kuzyakov 2021, Wang 2021, Abedon 2017]. Longitudinal monitoring ensures that both pathogen suppression and beneficial community enrichment persist, maintaining ecosystem balance and crop resilience.

**Approach**: Identify key pathogens and specific phages; co-inoculate with beneficial microbes; monitor microbiome composition, soil health, and plant performance using longitudinal metagenomics and network analyses.

**Key References**: [Morella 2018], [Kuzyakov 2021], [Wang 2021], [Abedon 2017, "Phage Therapy in Agriculture"]

**Modifications**: Added ecological monitoring and referenced [Abedon 2017] for phage therapy in agriculture.
