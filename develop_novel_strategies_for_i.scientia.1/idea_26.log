**Title**: Adaptive Field Cycling and Functional Profiling for Microbiome Selection in Drought-Prone Soils

**Key Idea**: Iterative field selection combined with functional profiling of crop-associated microbiomes accelerates breeding of drought-resilient communities.

**Paragraph**: Cycling soils through drought-stressed crops is strengthened by integrating functional metagenomics and metabolomics to directly select for microbiome traits linked to drought resistance [Swenson 2000, Panke-Buisse 2015, Xiong 2021]. This dual

**Approach**: ensures selection of both taxonomic and functional resilience.

**Approach**: Field-cycle soils through drought; profile rhizosphere microbiomes using metagenomics/metabolomics after each cycle; select and transfer high-performing communities.

**Key References**: [Swenson 2000], [Panke-Buisse 2015], [Xiong 2021, "Functional Traits and Microbiome Selection"]

**Modifications**: Added functional profiling to traditional cycling for more targeted selection. Added [Xiong 2021].
