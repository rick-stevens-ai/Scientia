# Final Report: Idea 17

## Final ELO Score: 1512.0

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Broad-Spectrum, Persistent Microbial Quorum Quenching Consortia for Targeted Pathogen Suppression and Rhizosphere Network Stability in Drought-Stressed Crops

**Key Idea**: Engineered or selected microbial consortia capable of degrading diverse quorum sensing signals, forming stable rhizosphere communities, and promoting beneficial microbial networks provide broad-spectrum and durable pathogen suppression under drought.

**Paragraph**: Promoting beneficial microbial network stability—alongside pathogen suppression—prevents secondary opportunistic blooms and supports long-term crop health [Niu 2017]. This holistic

**Approach**: addresses both breadth and durability in drought-stressed environments [Sharma 2020, Venturi 2016, Grandclément 2016, Dong 2019].

**Approach**: Engineer/select consortia for diverse quorum quenching and network-promoting traits; longitudinally monitor pathogen loads, microbial networks, plant health, and yield.

**Key References**: [Sharma 2020], [Venturi 2016], [Grandclément 2016], [Dong 2019], [Niu 2017]

**Modifications**: Added focus on network stability and opportunist suppression, citing [Niu 2017].
