**Title**: Designer Microbial Metabolite Cocktails as Scalable Biostimulants for Multi-Pathway Drought Protection in Crops

**Key Idea**: Application of defined, scalable mixtures of key microbial metabolites (e.g., lipopeptides, polysaccharides, phytohormones) synergistically activates multiple drought defense pathways in crops.

**Paragraph**: Rather than applying single metabolites, formulating cocktails targeting several plant defense pathways (e.g., osmotic regulation, ROS detoxification, hormonal signaling) can provide broad-spectrum, robust drought protection [Saikia 2018, Ola 2021, Calvo 2014, Colla 2017]. These biostimulants are scalable, tunable, and compatible with diverse agronomic systems.

**Approach**: Isolate and formulate metabolite cocktails tailored to crop and stress; test on multiple crops under drought; use transcriptomics and metabolomics to assess multi-pathway activation and yield outcomes.

**Key References**: [Saikia 2018], [Ola 2021], [Calvo 2014], [Colla 2017, "Microbial Biostimulants and Plant Stress Tolerance"]

**Modifications**: Added focus on scalability and compatibility with diverse systems; cited [Colla 2017].
