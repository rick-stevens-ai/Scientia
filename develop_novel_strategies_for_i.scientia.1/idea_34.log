**Title**: Directed Evolution and Synthetic Assembly of Plant Microbiomes for Climate Adaptation

**Key Idea**: Combining directed evolution with synthetic assembly of microbiomes yields communities optimized for drought resilience and rapid field deployment.

**Paragraph**: Directed evolution selects for drought-resilient traits, while synthetic assembly allows for rational design and rapid scaling of evolved consortia [Mueller 2019, Jochum 2019, Arora 2020]. This hybrid

**Approach**: accelerates translation from lab to field.

**Approach**: Perform directed evolution under drought; assemble high-performing strains into synthetic communities; test efficacy and scalability in multiple crop systems.

**Key References**: [Mueller 2019], [Jochum 2019], [Arora 2020, "Synthetic Microbiomes for Agriculture"]

**Modifications**: Added synthetic community assembly for scalability. Added [Arora 2020].
