## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Synthetic Biology-Enabled Designer Microbial VOCs for Crop-Specific, Stress-Responsive, and Environmentally Tunable Priming of Drought Adaptation Pathways

**Key Idea**: Engineering microbes to emit crop-specific, stress-responsive, and environmentally tunable blends of VOCs enables targeted and adaptable priming of plant defense and drought response pathways.

**Paragraph**: Environmentally tunable VOC emission—using synthetic promoters responsive to temperature, moisture, or nutrient cues—enables dynamic adaptation to field fluctuations, maximizing efficacy and minimizing negative impacts [Wei 2020]. This complements crop-specific and inducible VOC engineering for broad utility [Bitas 2013, Zhang 2019, Tyc 2017, Sharifi 2018].

**Approach**: Engineer microbial VOC production with environmental sensors; test in diverse crop and climate contexts; use transcriptomics and phenotyping for efficacy and off-target analysis.

**Key References**: [Bitas 2013], [Zhang 2019], [Tyc 2017], [Sharifi 2018], [Wei 2020, "Environmental Regulation of Microbial VOCs"]

**Modifications**: Added environmental tunability of VOC emission, citing [Wei 2020].
