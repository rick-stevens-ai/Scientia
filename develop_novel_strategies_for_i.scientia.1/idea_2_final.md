# Final Report: Idea 2

## Final ELO Score: 1513.1

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: CRISPR-Guided, Environmentally Responsive Root Exudate Engineering for Precision and Sustainable Microbiome Recruitment

**Key Idea**: CRISPR/Cas-mediated multiplex, inducible, and environmentally responsive editing of root exudate biosynthesis genes enables sustainable, dynamic, and context-specific recruitment of beneficial microbes for improved drought adaptation.

**Paragraph**: While multiplex and inducible genome editing of exudate pathways increases flexibility, incorporating environmental sensors (e.g., synthetic promoters responsive to soil moisture, temperature, or salinity) further tailors exudate profiles to real-time field conditions [Liu 2021]. This next-generation

**Approach**: , combined with computational exudate-microbe modeling, enhances predictive power and sustainability by minimizing off-target effects and resource use [Sasse 2018, Bulgarelli 2013, Zhalnina 2018, Dombrowski 2017].

**Approach**: Use CRISPR/Cas to edit exudate biosynthesis genes, incorporating both inducible and environment-responsive promoters; employ computational models for optimization; validate in greenhouse and multi-site field settings with real-time exudate and microbiome tracking.

**Key References**: [Sasse 2018], [Bulgarelli 2013], [Zhalnina 2018], [Dombrowski 2017], [Liu 2021, "Synthetic Promoters for Precision Agriculture"]

**Modifications**: Added environmentally responsive promoters for greater in-field precision, strengthened by [Liu 2021].
