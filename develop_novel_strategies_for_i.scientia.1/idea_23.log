**Title**: Endophyte-Delivered Multifunctional Osmoprotectants for Enhanced Crop Drought Resilience

**Key Idea**: Engineering endophytic bacteria to co-produce multiple plant-compatible osmoprotectants and stress-alleviating enzymes further enhances crop drought tolerance.

**Paragraph**: Beyond overproduction of osmolytes like proline or trehalose, endophytes can be engineered to simultaneously secrete antioxidant enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase), providing synergistic protection against both osmotic and oxidative stress during drought [Yang 2009, Vurukonda 2016, Ali 2014]. This multifunctionality increases efficacy and broadens stress resilience.

**Approach**: Engineer endophytes for both osmoprotectant and antioxidant enzyme production; inoculate crops and monitor physiological, molecular, and yield outcomes under drought.

**Key References**: [Yang 2009], [Vurukonda 2016], [Ali 2014, "Enhancement of Plant Drought Tolerance by Antioxidant-Producing Endophytes"]

**Modifications**: Added co-production of antioxidant enzymes for broader stress mitigation. Added [Ali 2014].
