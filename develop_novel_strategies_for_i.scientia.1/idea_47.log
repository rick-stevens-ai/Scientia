**Title**: Microbial Modulation of Multi-Hormone Networks for Precision Yield Optimization Under Drought

**Key Idea**: Engineering soil microbes to modulate interconnected plant hormone networks (ABA, cytokinins, auxins, gibberellins, ethylene) enables precise, context-dependent control of growth, stress response, and yield during drought.

**Paragraph**: Rather than targeting individual hormones, manipulating microbial consortia or strains that can coordinate multiple plant hormone pathways allows for nuanced and context-dependent regulation of plant development and stress response [Ngumbi 2016, Vacheron 2013, Meena 2017, Spaepen 2014]. This network-level modulation enables optimized trade-offs between drought resistance and productivity, tailored to crop stage and environmental severity.

**Approach**: Screen and engineer microbes for multi-hormone modulation capabilities and context-dependent expression; apply to crops; monitor hormone profiles, drought responses, and yield using multi-omics and phenotyping.

**Key References**: [Ngumbi 2016], [Vacheron 2013], [Meena 2017], [Spaepen 2014, "Plant Hormone Modulation by Rhizobacteria"]

**Modifications**: Added ethylene and emphasized network/interconnectedness; cited [Spaepen 2014] for comprehensive hormone modulation.
