**Title**: Harnessing Microbial Communication Molecules (Elicitors) to Synchronize Crop and Microbiome Drought Responses

**Key Idea**: Application of microbial-derived elicitors (e.g., N-acyl-homoserine lactones, oligosaccharides) can synchronize plant and microbial drought adaptation pathways for enhanced resilience.

**Paragraph**: Microbial communication molecules, traditionally viewed as intra- or inter-microbial signals, can also act as plant elicitors, priming defense and stress adaptation pathways [Hartmann 2014, Schikora 2016]. Exogenous application or in situ stimulation of these molecules may synchronize drought responses between plants and their microbiomes, leading to more coordinated and effective adaptation.

**Approach**: Identify/produce key microbial elicitors; apply as foliar or soil treatments; monitor plant-microbiome signaling, physiological responses, and yield under drought.
