**Title**: Precision Seed Coating with Next-Generation Microbial Consortia and Protective Matrices

**Key Idea**: Advanced seed coatings embedding multi-strain drought-adaptive consortia and protective polymers ensure reliable establishment and persistence of beneficial microbiomes.

**Paragraph**: Incorporating protective polymers or hydrogels into seed coatings, alongside microbial consortia, enhances microbial survival, colonization, and efficacy under field stress [Bashan 2014, Malusá 2016, Barros-Rodríguez 2022]. This

**Approach**: addresses environmental variability and operational scalability.

**Approach**: Develop and optimize seed coatings with protective matrices and consortia; conduct multi-environment field trials; assess microbiome establishment and crop performance.

**Key References**: [Bashan 2014], [Malusá 2016], [Barros-Rodríguez 2022, "Hydrogel-Enhanced Seed Coatings"]

**Modifications**: Added protective matrices/hydrogels for enhanced survival and scalability. Added [Barros-Rodríguez 2022].
