**Title**: Microbial Modulation of Multi-Hormone Pathways for Optimized Crop Yield Under Drought

**Key Idea**: Manipulating soil microbes to modulate multiple plant hormone pathways simultaneously can fine-tune growth, stress response, and yield under drought.

**Paragraph**: Rather than focusing on a single hormone, engineering or selecting microbes that influence a suite of hormones (ABA, cytokinins, auxins, gibberellins) allows for more precise tuning of plant responses to drought [Ngumbi 2016, Vacheron 2013, Meena 2017]. This multi-hormonal

**Approach**: provides greater flexibility and efficacy in optimizing both stress tolerance and productivity.

**Approach**: Select or engineer microbes with multi-hormonal modulation capabilities; apply to crops; monitor hormone profiles, drought responses, and yield.

**Key References**: [Ngumbi 2016], [Vacheron 2013], [Meena 2017, "Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria and Crop Productivity"]

**Modifications**: Extended to multi-hormone modulation for more nuanced plant response. Added [Meena 2017].
