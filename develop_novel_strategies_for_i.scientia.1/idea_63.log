**Title**: Harnessing Microbial Communication Molecules (Elicitors) for Synchronizing Crop and Microbiome Drought Responses

**Key Idea**: Application or stimulation of microbial-derived communication molecules (e.g., N-acyl-homoserine lactones, oligosaccharides) can synchronize plant and microbiome drought adaptation pathways for enhanced collective resilience.

**Paragraph**: Microbial communication molecules, once considered limited to microbe-microbe signaling, are increasingly recognized as plant elicitors that can modulate both plant and microbiome stress adaptation pathways [Hartmann 2014, Schikora 2016]. Exogenous application or targeted in situ stimulation of these molecules may allow for synchronized, community-wide drought responses, enhancing both plant and soil ecosystem resilience [Venturi 2016, Zamioudis 2014]. This

**Approach**: is distinct in focusing on cross-kingdom signaling rather than just direct plant or microbial manipulation.

**Approach**: Identify and produce key microbial elicitors; apply as soil or foliar treatments; monitor plant-microbiome signaling, physiological responses, and yield under drought; use molecular and phenotypic assays to confirm synchronization.

**Key References**: [Hartmann 2014], [Schikora 2016], [Venturi 2016], [Zamioudis 2014, "Rhizobacterial Elicitors and Plant Immunity"]

**Differentiation**: Unlike prior ideas, this leverages interkingdom signaling for system-level resilience, not just microbial or plant trait engineering.
