**Title**: Microbiome-Induced Epigenetic Priming and Heritable Drought Memory in Crop Plants

**Key Idea**: Beneficial microbes induce specific, heritable epigenetic modifications that prime crops for persistent and potentially transgenerational drought resilience.

**Paragraph**: Microbial priming not only triggers physiological adaptation but can also induce specific, heritable epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications) in plants [Conrath 2006, De Kesel 2021, Lämke 2017]. Evidence suggests some of these modifications are stably inherited, giving rise to “drought memory” that persists across generations and enables faster or stronger responses to subsequent drought events [Crisp 2016]. This

**Approach**: leverages both biochemical and heritable mechanisms for robust, long-term adaptation.

**Approach**: Inoculate crops with priming microbes; expose to drought; analyze physiological, molecular, and epigenetic markers; propagate subsequent generations to test heritability and persistence of drought memory.

**Key References**: [Conrath 2006], [De Kesel 2021], [Lämke 2017], [Crisp 2016, "Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance in Plants"]

**Modifications**: Clarified the nature of epigenetic changes (including histone modifications); cited [Crisp 2016] to bolster evidence for heritability and transgenerational effects.
