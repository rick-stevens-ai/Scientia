**Title**: High-Throughput Screening and Synthetic Assembly of Functionally Diverse Mycorrhizal Consortia for Drought-Adapted Crops

**Key Idea**: Combining high-throughput AMF strain selection with rational assembly of functionally diverse and compatible consortia creates robust, field-resilient mycorrhizal partnerships for crop drought resilience.

**Paragraph**: While high-throughput screening identifies AMF strains with superior drought adaptation, rationally assembling consortia that maximize both functional diversity (e.g., P-solubilization, water transport) and ecological compatibility mimics natural community structure for greater resilience [Augé 2001, Smith 2010, van der Heijden 2015, Sikes 2010]. This

**Approach**: buffers against environmental variability and pathogen invasion.

**Approach**: Screen AMF for complementary drought adaptation traits and compatibility; design consortia; validate colonization, persistence, and crop performance across diverse environments using multi-year trials.

**Key References**: [Augé 2001], [Smith 2010], [van der Heijden 2015], [Sikes 2010, "Ecological Functions of Mycorrhizal Diversity"]

**Modifications**: Added “ecological compatibility” and cited [Sikes 2010] for functions of mycorrhizal diversity; emphasized long-term, multi-environment validation.
