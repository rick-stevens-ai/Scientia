**Title**: Engineered Microbial Consortia for Simultaneous Drought and Salinity Stress Alleviation in Crops

**Key Idea**: Rationally designed microbial consortia with combined salt and drought tolerance traits can synergistically enhance crop resilience and yield in saline, arid soils.

**Paragraph**: Many drought-prone regions also face increasing soil salinity; combining salt-tolerant and drought-adaptive microbes in consortia leverages synergistic interactions for more robust plant stress mitigation [Egamberdieva 2019, Shrivastava 2015, Paul 2021, Numan 2018]. Such consortia can stabilize ion homeostasis, osmoprotection, and water uptake under dual stress conditions.

**Approach**: Isolate/engineer consortia with both salt and drought tolerance traits and metabolic complementarity; validate efficacy in multi-year, saline and drought-affected field soils; monitor plant and soil health, ion homeostasis, and yield.

**Key References**: [Egamberdieva 2019], [Shrivastava 2015], [Paul 2021], [Numan 2018, "Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria for Combined Abiotic Stress"]

**Modifications**: Added metabolic complementarity and ion homeostasis; cited [Numan 2018].
