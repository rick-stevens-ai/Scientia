# Final Report: Idea 6

## Final ELO Score: 1464.5

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Adaptive Field Cycling with Functional, Ecological, and Resistome Profiling for Elite Microbiome Selection in Drought-Prone Soils

**Key Idea**: Iterative field cycling, integrating functional, ecological, and resistome (antibiotic resistance gene) profiling, accelerates selection and deployment of robust, drought-resilient, and biosafe microbiomes.

**Paragraph**: Inclusion of resistome profiling ensures that selected microbiomes are not only stable and resilient but also avoid promoting undesirable resistance traits, supporting environmental safety [Zhu 2017]. This multi-dimensional screening, alongside functional and ecological profiling, enhances the ecological and regulatory viability of field-deployed microbiomes [Swenson 2000, Panke-Buisse 2015, Xiong 2021, Shade 2012].

**Approach**: Field-cycle soils under drought; profile microbiomes for functional traits, ecological stability, and resistome composition; select and transfer top-performing, biosafe communities.

**Key References**: [Swenson 2000], [Panke-Buisse 2015], [Xiong 2021], [Shade 2012], [Zhu 2017, "Soil Microbiome Resistome Surveillance"]

**Modifications**: Added resistome profiling for biosafety, citing [Zhu 2017].
