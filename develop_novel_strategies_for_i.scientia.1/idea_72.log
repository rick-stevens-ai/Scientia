**Title**: Integrated Phage-Microbiome Therapy for Selective Pathogen Suppression, Beneficial Microbiota Promotion, and Microbiome Network Resilience During Drought

**Key Idea**: Precision phage application, co-inoculation with beneficial microbes, and network-based microbiome monitoring selectively suppress drought-exacerbated pathogens while promoting beneficial microbiota and maintaining resilient microbial networks.

**Paragraph**: Beyond just population shifts, phage-microbiome strategies should prioritize microbiome network connectivity and functional redundancy to prevent collapse and ensure ecosystem services under drought [Santos-Medellín 2021]. Longitudinal, network-based monitoring better predicts system-level outcomes after intervention [Morella 2018, Kuzyakov 2021, Wang 2021, Abedon 2017].

**Approach**: Identify pathogens/phages; co-inoculate with network-stabilizing beneficials; monitor network structure and function using metagenomics and ecological modeling.

**Key References**: [Morella 2018], [Kuzyakov 2021], [Wang 2021], [Abedon 2017], [Santos-Medellín 2021, "Microbiome Networks and Resilience"]

**Modifications**: Added focus on microbiome network resilience, citing [Santos-Medellín 2021].
