**Title**: Real-Time Soil Microbiome Biosensors for Precision Drought Management in Agriculture

**Key Idea**: Deploying biosensors that detect shifts in soil microbiome activity and drought-relevant metabolites enables real-time, precision irrigation and input management.

**Paragraph**: Soil microbial activity and metabolite profiles change rapidly in response to drought, often preceding visible plant stress [Berges 2017, Kumar 2021]. Biosensors targeting microbial metabolites (e.g., exopolysaccharides, phytohormones, quorum signals) can provide early warning for drought onset or severity, allowing for responsive agricultural management and more efficient resource use.

**Approach**: Develop and field-deploy robust biosensors for key microbial metabolites; integrate data streams into precision agriculture platforms; correlate sensor data with crop health and yield outcomes.
