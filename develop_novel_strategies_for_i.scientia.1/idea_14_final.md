# Final Report: Idea 14

## Final ELO Score: 1522.3

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Directed Evolution and Synthetic Assembly of Climate-Adapted, Functionally Redundant Plant Microbiomes for Rapid and Sustainable Field Deployment

**Key Idea**: Combining directed evolution with synthetic assembly, functional redundancy, and ecological validation of microbiomes yields communities optimized for drought resilience and rapid, stable, and sustainable deployment in diverse field environments.

**Paragraph**: Functional redundancy within evolved/assembled consortia further buffers against environmental fluctuation and biotic invasion, ensuring sustained field function [Niu 2017]. This

**Approach**: enables rapid, sustainable translation from laboratory to field across multiple crops and climates [Mueller 2019, Jochum 2019, Arora 2020, Shade 2012].

**Approach**: Perform directed evolution under drought; assemble redundant, high-performing strains; validate for stability, compatibility, and efficacy in multi-crop, multi-environment field trials.

**Key References**: [Mueller 2019], [Jochum 2019], [Arora 2020], [Shade 2012], [Niu 2017]

**Modifications**: Added functional redundancy to bolster resilience, citing [Niu 2017].
