**Title**: Microbiome-Directed Root System Architecture Engineering for Enhanced Drought Foraging

**Key Idea**: Harnessing and engineering microbes that modulate specific root traits (depth, branching, angle) enables crops to optimize water uptake under drought.

**Paragraph**: Advances in imaging and genomics enable selection or engineering of microbes that specifically trigger desired root system architectures, such as deeper or more branched roots, to increase drought foraging [Finkel 2017, Glick 2012, Lynch 2019]. This precision

**Approach**: enables crop-specific solutions.

**Approach**: Identify and/or engineer microbes that alter root angles/depth; apply to crops; use high-throughput root phenotyping and drought performance assays.

**Key References**: [Finkel 2017], [Glick 2012], [Lynch 2019, "Root Architecture and Drought Adaptation"]

**Modifications**: Added root angle and high-throughput phenotyping. Added [Lynch 2019].
