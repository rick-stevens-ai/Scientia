# Final Report: Idea 7

## Final ELO Score: 1465.5

## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Engineered Multi-Functional Microbial Biofilms for Soil Aggregation, Water Retention, Nutrient Cycling, and Carbon Sequestration in Drought-Prone Cropping Systems

**Key Idea**: Inoculation with engineered, multi-functional biofilm-forming microbes enhances soil aggregation, water retention, nutrient cycling, pathogen suppression, and carbon sequestration to boost drought resilience and soil health.

**Paragraph**: In addition to water, nutrient, and pathogen benefits, biofilm-driven carbon sequestration—via stabilized microbial biomass and exopolysaccharides—can improve soil structure and long-term fertility [Zhalnina 2018]. This holistic

**Approach**: addresses climate resilience and sustainability [Rillig 2015, Sandhya 2009, Costa 2018, Bashan 2014].

**Approach**: Engineer/apply biofilm-forming microbes with multi-functional and carbon-sequestration traits; conduct multi-year/multi-location trials to assess soil structure, carbon, plant health, and yield.

**Key References**: [Rillig 2015], [Sandhya 2009], [Costa 2018], [Bashan 2014], [Zhalnina 2018, "Microbial Contributions to Soil Carbon Sequestration"]

**Modifications**: Added carbon sequestration as an additional benefit, supported by [Zhalnina 2018].
