**Title**: Multi-Mechanism Siderophore-Producing Microbial Consortia for Enhanced Iron Mobilization and Drought Resilience in Crops

**Key Idea**: Multi-strain consortia of siderophore-producing microbes with diverse iron-mobilizing mechanisms and rhizosphere persistence synergistically improve plant nutrition and drought resilience.

**Paragraph**: Drought-induced iron deficiency is best addressed by consortia of siderophore-producers exhibiting varied iron-mobilization strategies (e.g., catecholates, hydroxamates) and rhizosphere persistence traits [Rajkumar 2010, Dimkpa 2016, Sharma 2020, Ahmed 2014]. This

**Approach**: enhances both robustness and breadth of nutrient support across soils and environments.

**Approach**: Assemble consortia of siderophore-producers with complementary mechanisms and persistence traits; elucidate iron mobilization and plant uptake; monitor crop performance in droughted soils.

**Key References**: [Rajkumar 2010], [Dimkpa 2016], [Sharma 2020], [Ahmed 2014, "Siderophores: Diversity and Plant Growth Promotion"]

**Modifications**: Specified siderophore mechanism diversity and persistence; cited [Ahmed 2014].
