**Title**: Real-Time Soil Microbiome Biosensors and Digital Twins for Precision Drought Management in Agriculture

**Key Idea**: Deploying real-time biosensors for soil microbiome activity and drought-related metabolites, integrated into digital twin models, enables precision irrigation and input management for optimal crop resilience.

**Paragraph**: Soil microbial activity and metabolite profiles often change ahead of visible plant stress; biosensors targeting microbial metabolites (e.g., exopolysaccharides, phytohormones, quorum signals) provide early warning for drought onset or severity [Berges 2017, Kumar 2021]. Integrating these data streams into digital twin models of fields allows for real-time, adaptive management of irrigation and inputs, maximizing efficiency and resilience [Rai 2021, Jones 2020]. This

**Approach**: is unique in coupling biosensing with digital simulation for proactive, site-specific management.

**Approach**: Develop robust biosensors for key microbial metabolites; field-deploy sensors and feed data into digital twin models; use model outputs to guide precision irrigation and input decisions; correlate with crop health and yield.

**Key References**: [Berges 2017], [Kumar 2021], [Rai 2021], [Jones 2020, "Digital Twins in Agriculture"]

**Differentiation**: Distinct from prior ideas by linking biosensors and digital twins for actionable, real-time drought management.
