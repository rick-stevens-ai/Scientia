**Title**: Engineered Multi-Functional Microbial Biofilms for Soil Aggregation, Water Retention, and Nutrient Cycling in Drought-Prone Cropping Systems

**Key Idea**: Inoculation with engineered, multi-functional biofilm-forming microbes enhances soil aggregation, water retention, and nutrient cycling, collectively boosting crop drought resilience and soil health.

**Paragraph**: Engineered biofilm-formers can be endowed with multiple functions—including exopolysaccharide production for water retention, nutrient cycling (e.g., phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation), and even pathogen suppression—thus providing integrated, multi-dimensional benefits for crops in drought-prone soils [Rillig 2015, Sandhya 2009, Costa 2018, Bashan 2014]. This

**Approach**: not only addresses water and nutrient limitations but also strengthens soil structure and ecosystem resilience.

**Approach**: Engineer and apply multi-functional, biofilm-forming microbes; assess impacts on soil structure, nutrient availability, pathogen load, and crop performance under drought in multi-year, multi-location trials.

**Key References**: [Rillig 2015], [Sandhya 2009], [Costa 2018], [Bashan 2014, "Microbial Biofilms in Agriculture"]

**Modifications**: Added pathogen suppression and multi-year/multi-location trialing for generalizability; cited [Bashan 2014] to support broad biofilm functions.
