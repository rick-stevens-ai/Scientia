**Title**: Integrative Multi-Omics and Predictive Modeling for Custom Microbiome Engineering in Crop Drought Resilience

**Key Idea**: Integrating multi-omics data with machine learning enables predictive design and field optimization of custom-tailored microbiomes for drought resilience.

**Paragraph**: While multi-omics reveals plant-microbe interactions, combining these datasets with machine learning models allows for predictive identification and assembly of optimized consortia, accelerating field translation [Xu 2021, Oyserman 2018, Chang 2021]. This integrative strategy guides rational design and rapid optimization.

**Approach**: Perform multi-omics on crop-microbiome systems under drought; build predictive models to design consortia; iteratively test and optimize in field trials.

**Key References**: [Xu 2021], [Oyserman 2018], [Chang 2021, "Machine Learning for Microbiome Engineering"]

**Modifications**: Added machine learning for predictive design and rapid field optimization. Added [Chang 2021].
