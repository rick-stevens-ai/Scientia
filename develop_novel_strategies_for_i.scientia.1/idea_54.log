**Title**: Microbiome-Directed Engineering of Root System Architecture for Enhanced Drought Foraging and Resource Use Efficiency

**Key Idea**: Harnessing and engineering microbes that modulate specific root traits (depth, branching, angle, and plasticity) enables crops to maximize water acquisition and resource use efficiency under drought.

**Paragraph**: Recent advances in high-throughput imaging and root phenotyping, combined with genomics, facilitate the selection or engineering of microbes that trigger optimal root system architectures (e.g., deeper roots, increased branching, plastic adaptation) for enhanced drought foraging [Finkel 2017, Glick 2012, Lynch 2019, Atkinson 2019]. This precision

**Approach**: allows crop- and environment-specific solutions with improved resource use efficiency.

**Approach**: Identify/engineer microbes affecting root depth, angle, branching, and plasticity; apply to crops; use high-throughput root phenotyping and field-based drought performance assays.

**Key References**: [Finkel 2017], [Glick 2012], [Lynch 2019], [Atkinson 2019, "Root System Architecture and Crop Improvement"]

**Modifications**: Added root plasticity and resource use efficiency; cited [Atkinson 2019].
