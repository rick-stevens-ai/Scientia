**Title**: Engineered Microbial Biofilms for Soil Structure, Water Retention, and Nutrient Cycling Enhancement

**Key Idea**: Inoculation with engineered biofilm-forming microbes improves soil aggregation, water retention, and nutrient cycling, collectively bolstering drought resilience.

**Paragraph**: Beyond physical stabilization, engineered biofilm-formers can be endowed with nutrient-cycling capacities (e.g., phosphate solubilization), providing multi-functional benefits for crops under drought [Rillig 2015, Sandhya 2009, Costa 2018]. This combined

**Approach**: addresses both water and nutrient limitations.

**Approach**: Engineer and apply biofilm-forming, nutrient-cycling microbes; assess soil structure, nutrient availability, and crop performance under drought.

**Key References**: [Rillig 2015], [Sandhya 2009], [Costa 2018, "Microbial Biofilms as Engines of Soil Nutrient Cycling"]

**Modifications**: Added nutrient cycling as a functional extension; cited [Costa 2018].
