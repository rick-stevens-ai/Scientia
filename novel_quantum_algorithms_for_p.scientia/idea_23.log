**Title**: Quantum Algorithm for Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem
-

**Key Idea**: Developing a quantum algorithm for breaking elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) using quantum computers and advanced quantum techniques.
-

**Paragraph**: ECC is a widely used public-key cryptographic system, and its security relies on the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) [Koblitz 1987]. A quantum algorithm for solving the ECDLP could have significant implications for cryptographic systems. Recent advancements in quantum computing [Childs et al. 2017] could provide new insights into solving ECDLP efficiently.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm, its variants, and advanced quantum techniques like quantum walks [Ambainis 2012] to solve the ECDLP.
