**Title**: Quantum Algorithms for Lattice-Based Cryptography Using Quantum Sampling
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum algorithms for lattice-based cryptography to enhance security and efficiency using quantum sampling.
-

**Paragraph**: Lattice-based cryptography is a promising area of research in cryptography [Micciancio and Regev 2004]. Quantum algorithms could provide new insights and capabilities for lattice-based cryptography. Recent studies on quantum sampling [Bremner et al. 2016] could provide a foundation for this research. By integrating quantum sampling and advanced quantum techniques, we can develop more efficient and secure lattice-based cryptographic protocols.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum algorithms like quantum sampling [Bremner et al. 2016] for lattice-based cryptography.
