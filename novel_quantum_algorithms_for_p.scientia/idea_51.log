**Key Idea**: Developing quantum-enhanced zero-knowledge proofs using multi-qubit systems to improve security and efficiency.
-

**Paragraph**: Zero-knowledge proofs are crucial for privacy-preserving authentication and verification. Quantum-enhanced zero-knowledge proofs using multi-qubit systems [Brassard et al. 1985] could provide new security guarantees.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the application of multi-qubit systems for quantum-enhanced zero-knowledge proofs.
