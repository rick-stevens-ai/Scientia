**Title**: Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Prime Number Generation
-

**Key Idea**: Developing a quantum algorithm for generating prime numbers using a combination of quantum parallelism, classical techniques, and advanced mathematical tools.
-

**Paragraph**: Prime number generation is a fundamental problem in number theory, and current algorithms are not efficient for large-scale prime number generation [Siegel 1994]. A quantum algorithm for generating prime numbers could be more efficient and have significant implications for cryptography. Recent studies on quantum algorithms for number theory [Siegel 1994] could provide a foundation for this research.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum parallelism, classical techniques such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and advanced mathematical tools like modular forms [Serre 1977] to develop a new quantum algorithm for prime number generation.
