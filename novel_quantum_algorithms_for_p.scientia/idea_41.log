**Title**: Quantum-Enhanced Cryptographic Hash Functions Using Quantum Resistance
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum-enhanced cryptographic hash functions that are resistant to quantum computer attacks.
-

**Paragraph**: Cryptographic hash functions are essential for data integrity and security. With the advent of quantum computers, current hash functions may become vulnerable. Quantum-enhanced hash functions using quantum resistance [Rogaway and Shrimpton 2004] could provide new security guarantees.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum-resistant algorithms like lattice-based cryptography [Micciancio and Regev 2004] to develop quantum-enhanced cryptographic hash functions.
