- **Policy Interventions**: Considering how policy changes could help adapt agricultural practices to climate change.

### Meta-review

The Meta-review agent assessed the overall process, noting that while the hypotheses are well-founded and relevant, there is a need for a more detailed analysis of socio-economic factors and technological mitigation strategies.

### Conclusion

All hypotheses produced in Round 1 will continue to the next phase for further refinement and deeper analysis. The rankings indicate a strong interest in understanding crop yield reductions, shifts in growing seasons, and the socio-economic implications of climate change on food security. The system will focus on integrating technological innovations and policy interventions in subsequent rounds.
