**Title**: Quantum Key Distribution with Quantum Error Correction for Enhanced Security
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum key distribution protocols with quantum error correction to enhance security and efficiency.
-

**Paragraph**: Quantum key distribution [Bennett et al. 1993] is a secure method for key exchange. Integrating quantum error correction [Shor 1996] could enhance the security and efficiency of quantum key distribution protocols.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum error correction techniques like surface codes [Bravyi and Barenco 2015] for quantum key distribution.
