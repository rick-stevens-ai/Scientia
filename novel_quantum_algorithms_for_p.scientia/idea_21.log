**Title**: Optimized Quantum Factoring with Enhanced Shor's Algorithm
-

**Key Idea**: Optimizing Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers using quantum computers with a focus on reducing the number of qubits required and enhancing computational efficiency.
-

**Paragraph**: Shor's algorithm [Shor 1994] is a well-known quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithms. However, it requires a large number of qubits and has a high computational overhead. Optimizing Shor's algorithm to reduce the number of qubits required and enhance computational efficiency could make it more practical for near-term quantum devices. Recent advancements in quantum error correction [Shor 1996] and optimized quantum circuits [Nielsen and Chuang 2010] could be integrated to achieve this.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum error correction techniques such as surface codes [Bravyi and Barenco 2015] and optimized quantum circuits to reduce the number of qubits required for Shor's algorithm. Additionally, explore the application of near-term quantum devices' capabilities [Preskill 2018].
