**Title**: Quantum-Inspired Optimization for Cryptographic Protocols Using Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum-inspired optimization algorithms for cryptographic protocols to enhance security and efficiency using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
-

**Paragraph**: Cryptographic protocols often rely on complex optimization problems. Quantum-inspired optimization algorithms like QAOA [Farhi et al. 2014] could provide new insights and capabilities for optimizing cryptographic protocols. By integrating QAOA and advanced quantum techniques, we can develop more efficient and secure cryptographic protocols.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum-inspired optimization algorithms like QAOA for optimizing cryptographic protocols like key exchange and digital signatures.
