**Title**: Quantum-Secure Communication Networks Using Quantum Key Distribution
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum algorithms and protocols for secure communication networks to enhance data privacy and security using quantum key distribution.
-

**Paragraph**: Secure communication networks are a fundamental problem in cryptography [Shannon 1949]. Quantum algorithms and protocols could provide new insights and capabilities for secure communication networks. Recent studies on quantum key distribution [Bennett et al. 1993] could provide a foundation for this research. By integrating quantum key distribution and advanced quantum techniques, we can develop more secure and efficient communication networks.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum algorithms like quantum key distribution [Bennett et al. 1993] for secure communication networks.
