## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Enhanced Quantum Algorithm for Discrete Logarithm Problem Using Advanced Mathematical Tools and Classical Techniques
-

**Key Idea**: Developing an enhanced quantum algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) using a combination of quantum parallelism, classical techniques, and advanced mathematical tools like algebraic number theory and index calculus.
-

**Paragraph**: The DLP is a fundamental problem in number theory and cryptography, and solving it efficiently could have significant implications for cryptographic systems [Menezes et al. 1996]. While Shor's algorithm can solve some instances of the DLP, it is not universally applicable. A new quantum algorithm that combines quantum parallelism with classical techniques such as index calculus [Joux 2004] and advanced mathematical tools like algebraic number theory [Watkins 2007] could be more efficient. By integrating these tools, we can develop a more comprehensive and efficient algorithm for solving DLP.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum parallelism, classical techniques such as index calculus, and advanced mathematical tools like algebraic number theory [Watkins 2007] to develop a new quantum algorithm for the DLP.
