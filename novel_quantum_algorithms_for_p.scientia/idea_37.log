**Title**: Quantum Secure Multi-Party Computation Using Quantum Homomorphic Encryption
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum algorithms and protocols for secure multi-party computation to enhance data privacy and security using quantum homomorphic encryption.
-

**Paragraph**: Secure multi-party computation is a fundamental problem in cryptography [Yao 1982]. Quantum algorithms and protocols could provide new insights and capabilities for secure multi-party computation. Recent studies on quantum homomorphic encryption [Gentry 2009] could provide a foundation for this research. By leveraging quantum homomorphic encryption and advanced quantum techniques, we can develop more secure and efficient multi-party computation protocols.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum algorithms like quantum homomorphic encryption [Gentry 2009] for secure multi-party computation.
