**Title**: Quantum Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection in Cryptographic Systems
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in cryptographic systems to enhance security and efficiency.
-

**Paragraph**: Machine learning algorithms have shown great promise in detecting anomalies in cryptographic systems [Shai Shalev-Shwartz et al. 2004]. Quantum machine learning could provide new insights and capabilities for anomaly detection in cryptographic systems.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum machine learning algorithms like quantum support vector machines [Schuld and Brun 2017] for anomaly detection in cryptographic systems.
