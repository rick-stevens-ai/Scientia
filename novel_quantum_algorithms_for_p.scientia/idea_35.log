**Title**: Quantum Machine Learning for Cryptography Using Quantum Support Vector Machines
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum machine learning algorithms for cryptographic applications such as key generation and cryptographic protocol optimization using quantum support vector machines.
-

**Paragraph**: Machine learning algorithms have shown great promise in cryptography [Shai Shalev-Shwartz et al. 2004]. Quantum machine learning could provide new insights and capabilities for cryptographic applications. Recent studies on quantum machine learning [Childs et al. 2017] and quantum support vector machines [Schuld and Brun 2017] could provide a foundation for this research. By leveraging quantum support vector machines and advanced quantum techniques, we can enhance the efficiency and applicability of quantum machine learning for cryptography.
