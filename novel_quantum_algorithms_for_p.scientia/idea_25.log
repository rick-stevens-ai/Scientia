**Title**: Quantum Machine Learning for Cryptography
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum machine learning algorithms for cryptographic applications such as key generation and cryptographic protocol optimization.
-

**Paragraph**: Machine learning algorithms have shown great promise in cryptography [Shai Shalev-Shwartz et al. 2004]. Quantum machine learning could provide new insights and capabilities for cryptographic applications. Recent studies on quantum machine learning [Childs et al. 2017] could provide a foundation for this research.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of quantum machine learning algorithms like quantum support vector machines [ Schuld and Brun 2017] for cryptographic applications.
