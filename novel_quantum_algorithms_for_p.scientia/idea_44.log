**Title**: Quantum-Resistant Digital Signatures Using Lattice-Based Cryptography
-

**Key Idea**: Developing quantum-resistant digital signatures using lattice-based cryptography to enhance security and efficiency.
-

**Paragraph**: Digital signatures are essential for data authenticity and security. Current digital signatures may become vulnerable to quantum computer attacks. Quantum-resistant digital signatures using lattice-based cryptography [Micciancio and Regev 2004] could provide new security guarantees.
-

**Approach**: Investigate the use of lattice-based cryptography [Micciancio and Regev 2004] to develop quantum-resistant digital signatures.
