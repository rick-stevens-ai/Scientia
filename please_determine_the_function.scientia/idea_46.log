**Approach**: - Perform protein secretion assays (e.g., culture filtrate western blot).
   - Use macrophages from wild-type and TLR2/TLR4 knockout mice to assess cytokine profiles and bacterial survival upon Rv0331 exposure.
   - Conduct direct protein-protein binding assays (e.g., co-immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance) to confirm Rv0331-TLR interactions.
   - Test in vivo using murine infection models to determine the impact of Rv0331 deletion on immune response and disease progression.
