**Key Idea**: strengthens the original by specifying the mechanism (lipid modification leading to altered permeability) and directly linking molecular function to phenotypic drug resistance, making it more actionable for both basic and translational research.

**Paragraph**: The unique, lipid-rich cell wall of M. tuberculosis is both a virulence determinant and a major barrier to antibiotic entry [Brennan 1995]. Rv0331, based on domain analysis and expression data, is predicted to function in the synthesis or modification of critical cell envelope lipids, such as arabinogalactan or lipoarabinomannan [Jankute 2015]. Altered lipid content may reduce cell wall permeability to antibiotics and immune effectors, contributing to resistance. This refined hypothesis strengthens the original by specifying the mechanism (lipid modification leading to altered permeability) and directly linking molecular function to phenotypic drug resistance, making it more actionable for both basic and translational research.

   - **Modifications**:
     - Clarified mechanism: lipid modification → altered permeability → drug resistance.
     - Linked specific lipid targets to phenotype.
     - Maintained and extended relevant citations.
