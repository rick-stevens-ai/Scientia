## Final Hypothesis

**Title**: Rv0331 as a Modulator of Host Cell Death Pathways to Promote Intracellular Survival

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 manipulates host cell death pathways, such as apoptosis and necroptosis, to create a favorable intracellular niche for M. tuberculosis.

**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis actively modulates host cell death mechanisms to avoid premature clearance and establish persistent infection [Behar 2010]. While some effectors block apoptosis, others promote necrosis to facilitate bacterial dissemination [Danelishvili 2003; Amaral 2019]. Rv0331, upregulated during infection, could function as a secreted effector that interacts with host death-regulatory proteins or signaling pathways, tipping the balance toward forms of cell death that benefit M. tuberculosis. Targeting cell death manipulation is a promising area for host-directed therapies, and understanding Rv0331's role would enable novel interventions.

**Approach**: - Infect macrophages with wild-type and Rv0331-deficient M. tuberculosis; measure apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis markers (e.g., caspase activity, MLKL phosphorylation).
- Test Rv0331 protein addition to host cells for direct effects on cell death pathways.
- Use inhibitors or CRISPRi screens to identify host interactors of Rv0331.

### Title

Rv0331 as a Modulator of Host Cell Death Pathways to Promote Intracellular Survival

### Key Idea

Rv0331 manipulates host cell death pathways, such as apoptosis and necroptosis, to create a favorable intracellular niche for M. tuberculosis.

### Detailed Explanation

M. tuberculosis actively modulates host cell death mechanisms to avoid premature clearance and establish persistent infection [Behar 2010]. While some effectors block apoptosis, others promote necrosis to facilitate bacterial dissemination [Danelishvili 2003; Amaral 2019]. Rv0331, upregulated during infection, could function as a secreted effector that interacts with host death-regulatory proteins or signaling pathways, tipping the balance toward forms of cell death that benefit M. tuberculosis. Targeting cell death manipulation is a promising area for host-directed therapies, and understanding Rv0331's role would enable novel interventions.

### Implementation Approach

- Infect macrophages with wild-type and Rv0331-deficient M. tuberculosis; measure apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis markers (e.g., caspase activity, MLKL phosphorylation).
- Test Rv0331 protein addition to host cells for direct effects on cell death pathways.
- Use inhibitors or CRISPRi screens to identify host interactors of Rv0331.
