**Paragraph**: The lipid-rich cell wall of M. tuberculosis is critical for pathogenicity and drug resistance [Brennan 1995]. Rv0331â€™s predicted domain structure aligns with lipid metabolic enzymes, suggesting a role in both cell wall biosynthesis and modification, which can alter permeability to antibiotics and host defenses [Jankute 2015].
