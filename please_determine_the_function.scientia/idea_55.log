**Key Idea**: broadens the regulatory scope to include persistence genes—key for latent infection—while emphasizing the integration of multiple environmental signals. This makes the hypothesis more comprehensive and directly links molecular regulation to the pathogen’s ability to persist in the host.

**Paragraph**: Successful long-term survival of M. tuberculosis hinges on its ability to sense and adapt to diverse stressors, including hypoxia, nutrient limitation, and immune pressure [Voskuil 2003]. Rv0331, containing predicted DNA-binding motifs, is positioned as a global regulator that orchestrates the expression of both stress response and dormancy regulon genes [Rustad 2009]. This refined hypothesis broadens the regulatory scope to include persistence genes—key for latent infection—while emphasizing the integration of multiple environmental signals. This makes the hypothesis more comprehensive and directly links molecular regulation to the pathogen’s ability to persist in the host.

   - **Modifications**:
     - Expanded target regulon to include persistence/dormancy genes.
     - Emphasized integration of multiple environmental signals.
     - Maintained and strengthened citation support.
