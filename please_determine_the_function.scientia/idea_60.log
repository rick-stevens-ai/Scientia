**Paragraph**: Iron sequestration is a key host defense mechanism, and M. tuberculosis counters this by producing siderophores to scavenge iron [Ratledge 2000]. Co-expression of Rv0331 with iron-regulated genes and its predicted functional domains suggest it modulates siderophore biosynthesis or function, thereby optimizing iron acquisition and promoting survival within macrophages [Chao 2019]. This refinement strengthens the link by emphasizing direct regulatory or enzymatic roles in the siderophore pathway, providing a clearer target for intervention and experimental validation.

   - **Modifications**:
     - Specified direct regulatory or enzymatic role in siderophore pathway.
     - Reiterated importance for survival in macrophages.
     - Maintained and supplemented citations.
