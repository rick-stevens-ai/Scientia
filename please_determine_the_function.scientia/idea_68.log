**Title**: Rv0331 as a Mediator of Intracellular Nutrient Sensing and Adaptive Metabolic Remodeling in M. tuberculosis

**Key Idea**: Rv0331 senses host-derived nutrient cues and mediates metabolic remodeling for optimal survival during intracellular infection.

**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis must adapt to nutrient fluctuations within host macrophages, shifting metabolic programs to utilize available carbon, nitrogen, or lipid sources [Eisenreich 2013]. Proteins that sense or relay nutrient status are critical for this adaptation [Gouzy 2014]. Rv0331, given its expression profile and potential regulatory domains, could serve as a sensor or regulator of nutrient-responsive metabolic pathways, enabling M. tuberculosis to shift between glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid catabolism as needed. This would represent a novel role for Rv0331, linking environmental sensing to adaptive metabolic responses that underpin persistence and virulence.

**Approach**: - Profile Rv0331 expression under various nutrient conditions (carbon, nitrogen, lipid limitation).
- Use metabolomics and transcriptomics in wild-type and Rv0331 knockout strains to identify metabolic changes.
- Assess survival in macrophages under nutrient-restricted conditions and after genetic or pharmacological perturbation of key metabolic pathways.

**Summary of Refinements:**
- Each hypothesis was extended or clarified to include additional downstream effects, broader regulatory/scientific context, or additional mechanisms (e.g., inflammasome inhibition, antibiotic tolerance, oxidative stress resistance, immune evasion).
- New references were added to support newly introduced aspects.
- Two new, differentiated ideas were generated: one exploring host cell death manipulation and another focusing on nutrient sensing/metabolic remodeling, each with multidisciplinary citation support.
