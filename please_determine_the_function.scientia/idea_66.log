**Approach**: - Infect macrophages with wild-type and Rv0331-deficient M. tuberculosis; measure apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis markers (e.g., caspase activity, MLKL phosphorylation).
   - Test Rv0331 protein addition to host cells for direct effects on cell death pathways.
   - Use inhibitors or CRISPRi screens to identify host interactors of Rv0331.
