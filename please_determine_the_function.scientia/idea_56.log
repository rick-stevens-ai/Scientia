**Approach**: - Use ChIP-seq to identify genome-wide Rv0331 binding sites under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
   - Perform RNA-seq with Rv0331 knockout and overexpression strains to identify direct and indirect regulon targets.
   - Validate regulation of key stress and persistence genes by qPCR and promoter-lacZ fusions.
   - Assess the impact on survival in macrophage and mouse models of latent TB.
