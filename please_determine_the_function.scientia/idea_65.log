**Paragraph**: M. tuberculosis actively modulates host cell death mechanisms to avoid premature clearance and establish persistent infection [Behar 2010]. While some effectors block apoptosis, others promote necrosis to facilitate bacterial dissemination [Danelishvili 2003; Amaral 2019]. Rv0331, upregulated during infection, could function as a secreted effector that interacts with host death-regulatory proteins or signaling pathways, tipping the balance toward forms of cell death that benefit M. tuberculosis. Targeting cell death manipulation is a promising area for host-directed therapies, and understanding Rv0331's role would enable novel interventions.
