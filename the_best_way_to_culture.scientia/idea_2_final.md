# Final Report: Idea 2

## Final ELO Score: 1500.0

## Final Hypothesis

**Key Idea**: & Hypothesis:**  
Traditional fed-batch bioreactor control strategies for E. coli rely on indirect measurements and lack the sensitivity to detect early metabolic shifts, limiting growth optimization [Shiloach & Fass 2005; Lee 1996; Enfors 2001; Zhang et al. 2019]. We hypothesize that integrating rapid, real-time multi-omic data streams (e.g., metabolomics, transcriptomics) into the bioreactor control loop will allow for earlier detection of stress and metabolic bottlenecks, enabling adaptive interventions that maximize cell density and productivity beyond current methods. This multi-omic feedback layer will provide predictive power, allowing the system to preemptively adjust feeding, aeration, or induction regimes based on molecular signatures rather than lagging bulk metrics [Liu et al. 2020; Su et al. 2021].

**Approach**: . This multi-omic feedback layer will provide predictive power, allowing the system to preemptively adjust feeding, aeration, or induction regimes based on molecular signatures rather than lagging bulk metrics [Liu et al. 2020; Su et al. 2021].
